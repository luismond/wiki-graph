Unidentified_flying_object	An unidentified flying object (UFO) is an object or phenomenon seen in the sky but not yet identified or explained. The term was coined when United States Air Force (USAF) investigations into flying saucers found too broad a range of shapes reported to consider them all saucers or discs.[1] UFOs are also known as unidentified aerial phenomena or unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP).[2][3][4] Upon investigation, most UFOs are identified as known objects or atmospheric phenomena, while a small number remain unexplained.
Unidentified_flying_object	While unusual sightings in the sky have been reported since at least the 3rd century BC, UFOs became culturally prominent after World War II, escalating during the Space Age. Studies and investigations into UFO reports conducted by governments (such as Project Blue Book in the United States and Project Condign in the United Kingdom), as well as by organisations and individuals have occurred over the years without confirmation of the fantastical claims of small but vocal groups of ufologists who favour unconventional or pseudoscientific hypotheses, often claiming that UFOs are evidence of extraterrestrial intelligence, technologically advanced cryptids, interdimensional contact or future time travelers. After decades of promotion of such ideas by believers and in popular media, the kind of evidence required to solidly support such claims has not been forthcoming. Scientists and skeptic organizations such as the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry have provided prosaic explanations for UFOs, namely that they are caused by natural phenomena, human technology, delusions, and hoaxes. Although certain beliefs surrounding UFOs have inspired parts of new religions, social scientists have identified the ongoing interest and storytelling surrounding UFOs as a modern example of folklore and mythology understandable with psychosocial explanations.
Unidentified_flying_object	The problems of temporarily or permanently non-knowable anomalous phenomenon or perceived objects in flight is part of the philosophical subject epistemology.[5][6]
Unidentified_flying_object	The U.S. government has two entities dedicated to UFO data collection and analysis: NASA's UAP independent study team and the Department of Defense All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office.
Unidentified_flying_object	"During the late 1940s and through the 1950s, UFOs were often called ""flying saucers"" or ""flying discs"" based on reporting of the Kenneth Arnold incident.[7] ""Unidentified flying object"" (UFO) has been in-use since 1947.[8] The acronym ""UFO"" was coined by Captain Edward J. Ruppelt for the USAF. He wrote, ""Obviously the term 'flying saucer' is misleading when applied to objects of every conceivable shape and performance. For this reason the military prefers the more general, if less colorful, name: unidentified flying objects. UFO"".[9] The term UFO became widespread during the 1950s, at first in technical literature, but later in popular use.[10][11] ""Unidentified aerial phenomena"" (UAP) first appeared in the late 1960s. UAP has seen increasing usage in the 21st century due to negative cultural associations with ""UFO"".[8] UAP is sometimes expanded as ""unidentified anomalous phenomenon"".[12][13]"
Unidentified_flying_object	"While technically a UFO refers to any unidentified flying object, in modern popular culture the term UFO has generally become synonymous with alien spacecraft.[14] The term ""extra-terrestrial vehicle"" (ETV) is sometimes used to separate this explanation of UFOs from totally earthbound explanations.[15]"
Unidentified_flying_object	"Studies show that after careful investigation, the majority of UFOs can be identified as ordinary objects or phenomena. The 1952–1955 study for the USAF used the following categories: ""Balloon; Astronomical; Aircraft; Light phenomenon; Birds, Clouds, dust, etc.; Insufficient information; Psychological manifestations; Unknown; and Other"".[17] Identified sources of UFO reports are:"
Unidentified_flying_object	"An individual 1979 study by CUFOS researcher Allan Hendry found, as did other investigations, that fewer than one percent of cases he investigated were hoaxes and most sightings were actually honest misidentifications of prosaic phenomena. Hendry attributed most of these to inexperience or misperception.[27] Astronomer Andrew Fraknoi rejected the hypothesis that UFOs are extraterrestrial spacecraft and responded to the ""onslaught of credulous coverage"" in books, films and entertainment by teaching his students to apply critical thinking to such claims, advising them that ""being a good scientist is not unlike being a good detective"". According to Fraknoi, UFO reports ""might at first seem mysterious"", but ""the more you investigate, the more likely you are to find that there is LESS to these stories than meets the eye"".[28]"
Unidentified_flying_object	"People have always observed the sky and have sometimes seen what, to some, appeared to be unusual sights including phenomena as varied as comets, bright meteors, one or more of the five planets that can be readily seen with the naked eye, planetary conjunctions, and atmospheric optical phenomena such as parhelia and lenticular clouds.[citation needed] One particularly famous example is Halley's Comet: first recorded by Chinese astronomers in 240 BC and possibly as early as 467 BC as a strange and unknown ""guest light"" in the sky.[29] As a bright comet that visits the inner solar system every 76 years, it was often identified as a unique isolated event in ancient historical documents whose authors were unaware that it was a repeating phenomenon.[citation needed] Such accounts in history often were treated as supernatural portents, angels, or other religious omens.[citation needed] While UFO enthusiasts have sometimes commented on the narrative similarities between certain religious symbols in medieval paintings and UFO reports,[30] the canonical and symbolic character of such images is documented by art historians placing more conventional religious interpretations on such images.[31]"
Unidentified_flying_object	Some examples of pre-contemporary reports about unusual aerial phenomena include:
Unidentified_flying_object	"In the Pacific and European theatres during World War II, round, glowing fireballs known as ""foo fighters"" were reported by Allied and Axis pilots. Some explanations for these sightings included St. Elmo's fire, the planet Venus, hallucinations from oxygen deprivation, and German secret weapons (specifically rockets).[43] In 1946, more than 2,000 reports were collected, primarily by the Swedish military, of unidentified aerial objects over the Scandinavian nations, along with isolated reports from France, Portugal, Spain, Italy, and Greece. The objects were referred to as ""Russian hail"" (and later as ""ghost rockets"") because it was thought the mysterious objects were possibly Russian tests of captured German V1 or V2 rockets, but most were identified as natural phenomena as meteors.[44]"
Unidentified_flying_object	Many scholars, especially those arguing for the psychosocial UFO hypothesis, have noted that UFO characteristics reported after the first widely publicized modern sighting by Kenneth Arnold in 1947 resembled a host of science fiction tropes from earlier in the century.[45][46][47][48][49][50][51]
Unidentified_flying_object	"By most accounts, the popular UFO craze in the US began with a media frenzy surrounding the reports on June 24, 1947, of a civilian pilot named Kenneth Arnold who described seeing ""a group of bat-like aircraft flying in formation at high speeds"" near Mount Rainier that he said were ""moving like a saucer would if skipped across water"" which led to headlines about ""flying saucers"" and ""flying discs"".[52][53][54][55] Only weeks after Arnold's story was reported in 1947, Gallup published a poll asking people in the United States what the ""flying saucers"" might be. Already, 90% had heard of the new term. However, as reported by historian Greg Eghanian, ""a majority either had no idea what they could be or thought that witnesses were mistaken"" while ""visitors from space were not initially among the options that anyone had in mind, and Gallup didn't even mention if anyone surveyed brought up aliens.[53][56][57]"
Unidentified_flying_object	"Within weeks, reports of flying saucer sightings became a daily occurrence[58] with one particularly famous example being the Roswell incident in 1947 where remnants of a downed observation balloon were recovered by a farmer and confiscated by military personnel.[59] UFO enthusiasts in the early 1950s started to organize local ""saucer clubs"" modeled after science fiction fan clubs of the 1930s and 1940s, with some growing to national and international prominence within a decade.[53] In 1950, three influential books were published—Donald Keyhoe's The Flying Saucers Are Real, Frank Scully's Behind the Flying Saucers, and Gerald Heard's The Riddle of the Flying Saucers. Each guilelessly proposed that the extraterrestrial UFO hypothesis was the correct explanation and that the visits were in response to detonations of atomic weapons. These books also introduced Americans to, as Eghanian puts it, ""the crusading whistleblower dedicated to breaking the silence over the alien origins of unidentified flying objects"".[53] "
Unidentified_flying_object	"Media accounts and speculation ran rampant in the U.S., especially in connection to the 1952 UFO scare in Washington, D.C. so that, by 1953, the intelligence officials (Robertson Panel) worried that ""genuine incursions"" by enemy aircraft ""over U.S. territory could be lost in a maelstrom of kooky hallucination"" of UFO reports.[60] A Trendex survey in August 1957, ten years after the Arnold incident, reported that over 25% of the U.S. public ""believed unidentified flying objects could be from outer space"".[53] The cultural phenomenon showed up within some intellectual works such as the 1959 publication of Flying Saucers: A Modern Myth of Things Seen in the Sky by Carl Jung, a Swiss psychiatrist and psychoanalyst who founded analytical psychology.[61]"
Unidentified_flying_object	"Starting in 1947, the U.S. Air Force began to record and investigated UFO reports with Project Sign looking into ""more than 250 cases"" from 1947 to 1949. It was replaced by Project Grudge up through 1951.[62] In the third U.S. Air Force program, from March 1952 to its termination in December 1969,[63] ""the U.S. Air Force cataloged 12,618 sightings of UFOs as part of what is now known as Project Blue Book"".[64] In the late 1950s, public pressure mounted for a full declassification of all UFO records, but the CIA played a role in refusing to allow this.[65] This sense was not universal in the CIA, however, as fellow NICAP official Donald E. Keyhoe wrote that Vice Admiral Roscoe Hillenkoetter, the first director of the CIA, ""wanted public disclosure of UFO evidence"".[66] Official U.S. Air Force interest in UFO reports went on hiatus in 1969 after a study by the University of Colorado led by Edward U. Condon and known as the Condon Report concluded ""that nothing has come from the study of UFOs in the past 21 years that has added to scientific knowledge"" and that further time investigating UFO reports ""cannot be justified"".[64]"
Unidentified_flying_object	"From the 1960s to 1990s, UFOs were part of American popular culture's obsession with the supernatural and paranormal. In 1961, the first alien abduction account was sensationalized when Barney and Betty Hill underwent hypnosis after seeing a UFO and reported recovered memories of their experience that became ever more elaborate as the years went by.[67] In 1966, 5% of Americans reported to Gallup that ""they had at some time seen something they thought was a 'flying saucer'"", 96% said ""they had heard or read about flying saucers"", and 46% of these ""thought they were 'something real' rather than just people's imagination"".[68] Responding to UFO enthusiasm, there have always been consistent yet less popular efforts made at debunking many of the claims,[53] and at times the media was enlisted including a 1966 TV special, ""UFO: Friend, Foe or Fantasy?"", in which Walter Cronkite ""patiently"" explained to viewers that UFOs were fantasy.[60] Cronkite enlisted Carl Sagan and J. Allen Hynek, who told Cronkite, ""To this time, there is no valid scientific proof that we have been visited by spaceships"".[69]"
Unidentified_flying_object	"Such attempts to disenchant the zeitgeist were not very successful at tamping down the mania. Keith Kloor notes that the ""allure of flying saucers"" remained popular with the public into the 1970s, spurring production of such sci-fi films, as Close Encounters of the Third Kind and Alien, which ""continued to stoke public fascination"". Meanwhile, Leonard Nimoy narrated a popular occult and mystery TV series In Search of... while daytime talk shows of Mike Douglas, Merv Griffin, and Phil Donahue featured interviews with alien abductees and people who credulously reported stories about UFOs .[53] In the 1980s and 1990s, UFO stories featured in such pulp ""true crime"" serials as Unsolved Mysteries[70] while the 33 Volume Time-Life series Mysteries of the Unknown which featured UFO stories sold some 700,000 copies.[71] Kloor writes that by the late 1990s, ""other big UFO subthemes had been prominently introduced into pop culture, such as the abduction phenomenon and government conspiracy narrative, via best-selling books and, of course, The X-Files"".[69]"
Unidentified_flying_object	"Eghigian notes that, by this point, the UFO problem had become ""far more interesting to ponder than to actually solve.""[53] Interest was particularly fevered in the 1990s with the publicity surrounding the television broadcast of an Alien autopsy video marketed as ""real footage"" but later admitted to be a staged ""re-enactment"".[72] Eghigian writes that ""there had always been outlier abduction reports dating back to the '50s and '60s"" but that in the '80s and '90s ""the floodgates opened, and with them a new generation of UFO advocates"". Leaders among them were the artist Budd Hopkins, horror writer Whitley Strieber, historian David Jacobs, and Harvard psychiatrist John Mack. They all defended the ""veracity of those claiming to have been kidnapped, examined, and experimented upon by beings from another world"", writes Eghigian, as ""new missionaries who simultaneously played the role of investigator, therapist, and advocate to their vulnerable charges"".[53] Eghigian says that Mack ""signaled both the culmination and end of the headiest days of alien abduction"". When Mack began working with and publishing accounts of abductees—or ""experiencers"", as he called them—in the early 1990s, he brought a sense of legitimacy to ""the study of extraterrestrial captivity"". By the late 1990s, however, the Harvard Medical School initiated a review of his position which allowed him to retain tenure. However, after this review, as the review board chairman Arnold Relman later put it, Mack was ""not taken seriously by his colleagues anymore"". Claims of alien abduction have continued, but no other clinicians would continue to speak of them as real in any sense.[53] Nonetheless, these ideas persisted in popular opinion. According to a 1996 poll by Newsweek, 20% of Americans believed that UFOs were more likely to be proof of alien life than to have a natural scientific explanation.[73]"
Unidentified_flying_object	"In December 2017, a new round of media attention started when The New York Times broke the story of the secret Advanced Aviation Threat Identification Program that was funded from 2007 to 2012 with $22 million spent on the program.[74][75] Following this story, along with a series of sensationalized Pentagon UFO videos leaked by members of the program who became convinced that UFOs were genuine mysteries worth investigating, there was an increase in mainstream attention to UFO stories. In July 2021, Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb announced the creation of his Galileo Project which intended to use high-tech astronomical equipment to seek evidence of extraterrestrial artifacts in space and possibly within Earth's atmosphere. This was followed closely by the publication of Loeb's book Extraterrestrial, in which he argued that the first interstellar comet ever observed, 'Oumuamua, might be an artificial light sail made by an alien civilization.[53] Two government sponsored programs, NASA's UAP independent study team and the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office were charged in part by Congressional fiat to investigate UFO claims more fully,[76][77][78] adopting the new moniker ""unexplained aerial phenomenon"" (UAP) to avoid associations with past sensationalism.[79] On 17 May 2022, members of the United States House Intelligence Subcommittee on Counterterrorism, Counterintelligence and Counterproliferation held congressional hearings with top military officials to discuss military reports of UAPs.[80] It was the first public congressional hearing into UFO sightings in the US in over 50 years. Another Congressional hearing took place on July 26, 2023, featuring the whistleblower claims of former U.S. Air Force (USAF) officer and intelligence official David Grusch.[81][82][83]"
Unidentified_flying_object	"A Harris Poll in 2009 found that 32% of Americans ""believe in UFOs"".[84] A National Geographic study in June 2012 found that 36% of Americans believe UFOs exist and that 10% thought that they had spotted one.[85] In June 2021 a Pew research poll found that 51% in the United States thought that UFOs reported by people in the military were likely to be evidence of intelligent life from beyond the Earth.[86] In August 2021, Gallup, with a question not specific to military reports, only found that 41% of adults believed some UFOs involve alien spacecraft from other planets. This Gallup poll showed 44% of men and 38% of women believed this. This average of 41% in 2021 was up from 33% in a 2019 Gallup poll with the same question. Gallup further found that college graduates went in 2019 from being the least likely educational group to believe this to being on par in 2021 with adults who have no college education.[87] An October 2022 poll by YouGov only found that 34% of Americans believe that UFOs are likely to involve alien life forms.[88]"
Unidentified_flying_object	"Historian Greg Eghigian wrote in August 2021 that ""over the last fifty years, the mutual antagonism between paranormal believers and skeptics has largely framed discussion about unidentified flying objects"" and that ""it often gets personal"" with those taking seriously the prospect that UFOs are extraterrestrial in origin dismissing those who consider UFOs to be worth studying as ""narrow-minded, biased, obstinate, and cruel"" while the skeptics brushed off ""devotees"" as ""naïve, ignorant, gullible, and downright dangerous"". Such ""mudslinging over convictions is certainly familiar to historians of religion, a domain of human existence marked by deep divisions over interpretations of belief"", and science too has found itself engaged increasing amounts of ""boundary work"" (which is ""asserting and reasserting the borders between legitimate and illegitimate scientific research and ideas, between what may and what may not refer to itself as science"") with regard to UFO questions. Eghigian points out our current ""stark divide did not happen overnight, and its roots lie in the postwar decades, in a series of events that—with their news coverage, grainy images, celebrity crusaders, exasperated skeptics, unsatisfying military statements, and accusations of a government cover-up—foreshadow our present moment"".[53]"
Unidentified_flying_object	"UFOs have been taken up by religious studies scholars in various scholarly books.[89][90][91] Jeffrey Kripal, chair of the Department of Religion at Rice University, has said that ""both the material and the mental dimensions [of UFOs] are incredibly important to get a sense of the full picture"".[92] As Adrian Horton writes ""from The X-Files to Men in Black, Close Encounters of the Third Kind to Star Wars to Marvel, Hollywood has for decades provided an engrossing feedback loop for interest in the extraterrestrial: a reflection of our fears and capaciousness, whose ubiquitous popularity has in turn fueled more interest in UFOs as perennially compelling entertainment tropes not to be taken seriously"". Horton observes that these ""alien movies have generally reflected shifting cultural anxieties, from the existential terror of nuclear war to foreign enslavement to loss of bodily control"". American entertainment has explored both ""hostile aliens"" as well as the ""benevolent, world-expanding encounters"" seen in films such as Steven Spielberg's Close Encounters of the Third Kind and E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial.[93] In her research on the relationship of media to UFO beliefs, Diana Walsh Pasulka, a professor of philosophy and religion at the University of North Carolina, says that what is seen on a screen, ""if it conforms to certain criteria, is interpreted as real, even if it is not real and even if one knows it is not real"" and that ""screen images embed themselves in one's brain and memories"" in ways that ""can determine how one views one's past and even determine one's future behaviors"".[94]"
Unidentified_flying_object	UFOs have been subject to investigations over the years that varied widely in scope and scientific rigor. Governments or independent academics in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Japan, Peru, France, Belgium, Sweden, Brazil, Chile, Uruguay, Mexico, Spain, and the Soviet Union are known to have investigated UFO reports at various times. No official government investigation has ever publicly concluded that UFOs are indisputably real, physical objects, extraterrestrial in origin, or of concern to national defense.
Unidentified_flying_object	Among the best known government studies are the ghost rockets investigation by the Swedish military (1946–1947), Project Blue Book, previously Project Sign and Project Grudge, conducted by the USAF from 1947 until 1969, the secret U.S. Army/Air Force Project Twinkle investigation into green fireballs (1948–1951), the secret USAF Project Blue Book Special Report No. 14[95] by the Battelle Memorial Institute, and the Brazilian Air Force's 1977 Operação Prato (Operation Saucer). France has had an ongoing investigation (GEPAN/SEPRA/GEIPAN) within its space agency Centre national d'études spatiales (CNES) since 1977; the government of Uruguay has had a similar investigation since 1989.
Unidentified_flying_object	On October 31, 2008, the National Archives of Brazil began receiving from the Aeronautical Documentation and History Center part of the documentation of the Brazilian Air Force regarding the investigation of the appearance of UFOs in Brazil. Currently, this collection gathers cases between 1952 and 2016.[96]
Unidentified_flying_object	In 1968, the SEFAA (previously CEFAA) began receiving case reports of the general public, civil aviators and the Chilean Air Force regarding the sightings or the appearance of UFOs in Chile, the initial work was an initiative of Sergio Bravo Flores who led the Chilean Committee for the Study of Unidentified Space Phenomena, supported even by the Chilean Scientific Society. Currently, the organization changed its denomination to SEFAA and its a department of the DGAC(Chile) which in turn depends on the Chilean Air Force.[97]
Unidentified_flying_object	"In Canada, the Department of National Defence has dealt with reports, sightings and investigations of UFOs across Canada. In addition to conducting investigations into crop circles in Duhamel, Alberta, it still considers ""unsolved"" the Falcon Lake incident in Manitoba and the Shag Harbour UFO incident in Nova Scotia.[98]"
Unidentified_flying_object	Early Canadian studies included Project Magnet (1950–1954) and Project Second Storey (1952–1954), supported by the Defence Research Board.
Unidentified_flying_object	U.S. investigations into UFOs include:
Unidentified_flying_object	In addition to these, thousands of documents released under FOIA also indicate that many U.S. intelligence agencies collected (and still collect) information on UFOs. These agencies include the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), FBI,[101] CIA, National Security Agency (NSA), as well as military intelligence agencies of the Army and U.S. Navy, in addition to the Air Force.[note 1]
Unidentified_flying_object	"Following the large U.S. surge in sightings in June and early July 1947, on July 9, 1947, United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) intelligence, in cooperation with the FBI,[101] began a formal investigation into selected sightings with characteristics that could not be immediately rationalized, such as Kenneth Arnold's. The USAAF used ""all of its top scientists"" to determine whether ""such a phenomenon could, in fact, occur"". The research was ""being conducted with the thought that the flying objects might be a celestial phenomenon,"" or that ""they might be a foreign body mechanically devised and controlled.""[102] Three weeks later in a preliminary defense estimate, the air force investigation decided that, ""This 'flying saucer' situation is not all imaginary or seeing too much in some natural phenomenon. Something is really flying around.""[103]"
Unidentified_flying_object	"A further review by the intelligence and technical divisions of the Air Materiel Command at Wright Field reached the same conclusion. It reported that ""the phenomenon is something real and not visionary or fictitious,"" and there were disc-shaped objects, metallic in appearance, as big as man-made aircraft. They were characterized by ""extreme rates of climb [and] maneuverability"", general lack of noise, absence of a trail, occasional formation flying, and ""evasive"" behavior ""when sighted or contacted by friendly aircraft and radar"", suggesting a controlled craft. It was therefore recommended in late September 1947 that an official Air Force investigation be set up. It was also recommended that other government agencies should assist in the investigation.[note 2]"
Unidentified_flying_object	Project Sign's final report, published in early 1949, stated that while some UFOs appeared to represent actual aircraft, there was not enough data to determine their origin.[104]
Unidentified_flying_object	The Air Force's Project Sign was created at the end of 1947, and was one of the earliest government studies to come to a secret extraterrestrial conclusion. In August 1948, Sign investigators wrote a top-secret intelligence estimate to that effect, but the Air Force Chief of Staff Hoyt Vandenberg ordered it destroyed. The existence of this suppressed report was revealed by several insiders who had read it, such as astronomer and USAF consultant J. Allen Hynek and Capt. Edward J. Ruppelt, the first head of the USAF's Project Blue Book.[105]
Unidentified_flying_object	"Another highly classified U.S. study was conducted by the CIA's Office of Scientific Investigation (OS/I) in the latter half of 1952 in response to orders from the National Security Council (NSC). This study concluded UFOs were real physical objects of potential threat to national security. One OS/I memo to the CIA Director (DCI) in December read that ""the reports of incidents convince us that there is something going on that must have immediate attention ... Sightings of unexplained objects at great altitudes and traveling at high speeds in the vicinity of major U.S. defense installations are of such a nature that they are not attributable to natural phenomena or any known types of aerial vehicles.""[106]"
Unidentified_flying_object	The matter was considered so urgent that OS/I drafted a memorandum from the DCI to the NSC proposing that the NSC establish an investigation of UFOs as a priority project throughout the intelligence and the defense research and development community. It also urged the DCI to establish an external research project of top-level scientists, now known as the Robertson Panel to analyze the problem of UFOs. The OS/I investigation was called off after the Robertson Panel's negative conclusions in January 1953.[106]
Unidentified_flying_object	"Project Sign was dismantled and became Project Grudge at the end of 1948. Angered by the low quality of investigations by Grudge, the Air Force Director of Intelligence reorganized it as Project Blue Book in late 1951, placing Ruppelt in charge. J. Allen Hynek, a trained astronomer who served as a scientific advisor for Project Blue Book, was initially skeptical of UFO reports, but eventually came to the conclusion that many of them could not be satisfactorily explained and was highly critical of what he described as ""the cavalier disregard by Project Blue Book of the principles of scientific investigation"".[107] Leaving government work, he founded the privately funded CUFOS, to whose work he devoted the rest of his life. Other private groups studying the phenomenon include the MUFON, a grassroots organization whose investigator's handbooks go into great detail on the documentation of alleged UFO sightings."
Unidentified_flying_object	"Air Force Regulation 200-2,[108] issued in 1953 and 1954, defined an Unidentified Flying Object (""UFOB"") as ""any airborne object which by performance, aerodynamic characteristics, or unusual features, does not conform to any presently known aircraft or missile type, or which cannot be positively identified as a familiar object."" The regulation also said UFOBs were to be investigated as a ""possible threat to the security of the United States"" and ""to determine technical aspects involved."" The regulation went on to say that ""it is permissible to inform news media representatives on UFOB's when the object is positively identified as a familiar object"" but added: ""For those objects which are not explainable, only the fact that ATIC [Air Technical Intelligence Center] will analyze the data is worthy of release, due to many unknowns involved.""[108]"
Unidentified_flying_object	"A public research effort conducted by the Condon Committee for the USAF and published as the Condon Report arrived at a negative conclusion in 1968.[109] Blue Book closed down in 1970, using the Condon Committee's negative conclusion as a rationale, thus ending official Air Force UFO investigations. However, a 1969 USAF document, known as the Bolender memo, along with later government documents, revealed that non-public U.S. government UFO investigations continued after 1970. The Bolender memo first stated that ""reports of unidentified flying objects that could affect national security ... are not part of the Blue Book system,"" indicating that more serious UFO incidents already were handled outside the public Blue Book investigation. The memo then added, ""reports of UFOs which could affect national security would continue to be handled through the standard Air Force procedures designed for this purpose.""[note 3]"
Unidentified_flying_object	In the late 1960s, a chapter on UFOs in the Space Sciences course at the U.S. Air Force Academy gave serious consideration to possible extraterrestrial origins. When word of the curriculum became public, in 1970, the Air Force issued a statement to the effect that the book was outdated and cadets instead were being informed of the Condon Report's negative conclusion.[110]
Unidentified_flying_object	"Controversy surrounded the report, both before and after its release. It has been observed that the report was ""harshly criticized by numerous scientists, particularly at the powerful AIAA ... [which] recommended moderate, but continuous scientific work on UFOs.""[109] In an address to the AAAS, James E. McDonald said he believed science had failed to mount adequate studies of the problem and criticized the Condon Report and earlier studies by the USAF as scientifically deficient. He also questioned the basis for Condon's conclusions[111] and argued that the reports of UFOs have been ""laughed out of scientific court"".[112] J. Allen Hynek, an astronomer who worked as a USAF consultant from 1948, sharply criticized the Condon Committee Report and later wrote two nontechnical books that set forth the case for continuing to investigate UFO reports."
Unidentified_flying_object	Ruppelt recounted his experiences with Project Blue Book, a USAF investigation that preceded Condon's.[113]
Unidentified_flying_object	"According to a 1979 New York Times report, ""records from the C.I.A., the F.B.I. and other Federal agencies"" (""about 900 documents—nearly 900 pages of memos, reports and correspondence"") obtained in 1978 through the Freedom of Information Act request, indicate that ""despite official pronouncements for decades that U.F.O.'s were nothing more than misidentified aerial objects and as such were no cause for alarm ... the phenomenon has aroused much serious behind‐the‐scenes concern"" in the US government. In particular, officials were concerned over the ""approximately 10%"" of UFO sightings which remained unexplained, and whether they might be Soviet aircraft and a threat to national security.[114] Officials were concerned about the ""risk of false alerts"", of ""falsely identifying the real as phantom"", and of mass hysteria caused by sightings. In 1947, Brigadier General George F. Schulgen of Army Air Corps Intelligence, warned ""the first reported sightings might have been by individuals of Communist sympathies with the view to causing hysteria and fear of a secret Russian weapon.""[114]"
Unidentified_flying_object	In November 2011, the White House released an official response to two petitions asking the U.S. government to acknowledge formally that aliens have visited this planet and to disclose any intentional withholding of government interactions with extraterrestrial beings. According to the response:
Unidentified_flying_object	The U.S. government has no evidence that any life exists outside our planet, or that an extraterrestrial presence has contacted or engaged any member of the human race...no credible information to suggest that any evidence is being hidden from the public's eye....
Unidentified_flying_object	— Statement by the White House[115][116]
Unidentified_flying_object	"The response further noted that efforts, like SETI and NASA's Kepler space telescope and Mars Science Laboratory, continue looking for signs of life. The response noted ""odds are pretty high"" that there may be life on other planets but ""the odds of us making contact with any of them—especially any intelligent ones—are extremely small, given the distances involved.""[115][116]"
Unidentified_flying_object	"On June 25, 2021, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence released a report on UAPs.[117] The report found that the UAPTF was unable to identify 143 objects spotted between 2004 and 2021. The report said that 18 of these featured unusual movement patterns or flight characteristics, adding that more analysis was needed to determine if those sightings represented ""breakthrough"" technology. The report said that ""some of these steps are resource-intensive and would require additional investment.""[118] The report did not link the sightings to extraterrestrial life.[119][120]"
Unidentified_flying_object	The Uruguayan Air Force has conducted UFO investigations since 1989 and reportedly analyzed 2,100 cases of which they regard approximately 2% as lacking explanation.[121]
Unidentified_flying_object	Many people reported UFO sightings in and around the Pudasjärvi area in the North Ostrobothnia region in the late 1960s and early 1970s.[122][123][124] UFO researchers and the press only became interested in UFOs in the area after a sighting in September 1969, after which UFO researchers from other parts of Finland and Sweden visited the area.[122] An earthquake light has been proposed as an explanation for the Pudasjärvi phenomena.[125]
Unidentified_flying_object	In March 2007, the French space agency CNES published an archive of UFO sightings and other phenomena online.[126]
Unidentified_flying_object	French studies include GEPAN/SEPRA/GEIPAN within CNES (French space agency), the longest ongoing government-sponsored investigation. About 22% of the 6,000 cases studied remain unexplained.[127] The official opinion of GEPAN/SEPRA/GEIPAN has been neutral, stating on their FAQ page that their mission is fact-finding for the scientific community, not rendering an opinion. They add they can neither prove nor disprove the Extraterrestrial Hypothesis (ETH), but their Steering Committee's clear position is that they cannot discard the possibility that some fraction of the very strange 22% of unexplained cases might be due to distant and advanced civilizations.[128]
Unidentified_flying_object	"Possibly their bias may be indicated by their use of the terms ""PAN"" (French) or ""UAP"" (English equivalent) for ""Unidentified Aerospace Phenomenon"" (whereas ""UAP"" is normally used by English organizations stands for ""Unidentified Aerial Phenomenon"", a more neutral term). In addition, the three heads of the studies have gone on record in stating that UFOs were real physical flying machines beyond our knowledge or that the best explanation for the most inexplicable cases was an extraterrestrial one.[129][130][131] In 2007, the CNES's own report stated that, at that time, 28% of sightings remained unidentified.[132]"
Unidentified_flying_object	In 2008, Michel Scheller, president of the Association Aéronautique et Astronautique de France (3AF), created the Sigma Commission. Its purpose was to investigate UFO phenomena worldwide.[133] A progress report published in May 2010 stated that the central hypothesis proposed by the COMETA report is perfectly credible.[134] In December 2012, the final report of the Sigma Commission was submitted to Scheller. Following the submission of the final report, the Sigma2 Commission is to be formed with a mandate to continue the scientific investigation of UFO phenomena.[135][136]
Unidentified_flying_object	Alleged UFO sightings gradually increased since the war, peaking in 1978 and 2005. The total number of sightings since 1947 are 18,500, of which 90% are identifiable.[137]
Unidentified_flying_object	"The UK's Flying Saucer Working Party published its final report in June 1951, which remained secret for over fifty years. The Working Party concluded that all UFO sightings could be explained as misidentifications of ordinary objects or phenomena, optical illusions, psychological misperceptions/aberrations, or hoaxes. The report stated: ""We accordingly recommend very strongly that no further investigation of reported mysterious aerial phenomena be undertaken, unless and until some material evidence becomes available.""[138]"
Unidentified_flying_object	Eight file collections on UFO sightings, dating from 1978 to 1987, were first released on May 14, 2008, to The National Archives by the Ministry of Defence (MoD).[139] Although kept secret from the public for many years, most of the files have low levels of classification and none are classified Top Secret. 200 files are set to be made public by 2012. The files are correspondence from the public sent to the British government and officials, such as the MoD and Margaret Thatcher. The MoD released the files under the Freedom of Information Act due to requests from researchers.[140] These files include, but are not limited to, UFOs over Liverpool and Waterloo Bridge in London.[141]
Unidentified_flying_object	"On October 20, 2008, more UFO files were released. One case released detailed that in 1991 an Alitalia passenger aircraft was approaching London Heathrow Airport when the pilots saw what they described as a ""cruise missile"" fly extremely close to the cockpit. The pilots believed a collision was imminent. UFO expert David Clarke says this is one of the most convincing cases for a UFO he has come across.[142]"
Unidentified_flying_object	"A secret study of UFOs was undertaken for the Ministry of Defence between 1996 and 2000 and was code-named Project Condign. The resulting report, titled ""Unidentified Aerial Phenomena in the UK Defence Region"", was publicly released in 2006, but the identity and credentials of whoever constituted Project Condign remains classified. The report confirmed earlier findings that the main causes of UFO sightings are misidentification of man-made and natural objects. The report noted: ""No artefacts of unknown or unexplained origin have been reported or handed to the UK authorities, despite thousands of Unidentified Aerial Phenomena reports. There are no SIGINT, ELINT or radiation measurements and little useful video or still IMINT.""[143]"
Unidentified_flying_object	"It concluded: ""There is no evidence that any UAP, seen in the UKADR [UK Air Defence Region], are incursions by air-objects of any intelligent (extraterrestrial or foreign) origin, or that they represent any hostile intent."" A little-discussed conclusion of the report was that novel meteorological plasma phenomenon akin to ball lightning are responsible for ""the majority, if not all"" of otherwise inexplicable sightings, especially reports of black triangle UFOs.[143]"
Unidentified_flying_object	"On December 1, 2009, the Ministry of Defence quietly closed down its UFO investigations unit. The unit's hotline and email address were suspended by the MoD on that date. The MoD said there was no value in continuing to receive and investigate sightings in a release, stating that ""in over fifty years, no UFO report has revealed any evidence of a potential threat to the United Kingdom. The MoD has no specific capability for identifying the nature of such sightings. There is no Defence benefit in such investigation and it would be an inappropriate use of defence resources. Furthermore, responding to reported UFO sightings diverts MoD resources from tasks that are relevant to Defence."" The Guardian reported that the MoD claimed the closure would save the Ministry around £50,000 a year. The MoD said it would continue to release UFO files to the public through The National Archives.[144]"
Unidentified_flying_object	"UFO reports, Parliamentary questions, and letters from members of the public were released on August 5, 2010, to the UK National Archives. ""In one letter included in the files, a man alleges Churchill ordered a coverup of a WW II-era UFO encounter involving the Royal Air Force"".[145][139]"
Unidentified_flying_object	Reports of UFO sightings continue. According to The Independent, there were 957 reported UFO sightings across the UK between January 2021 and May 2023, with Manchester, London, Liverpool, and Glasgow being hotspots.[146]
Unidentified_flying_object	Critics argue that all UFO evidence is anecdotal[147] and can be explained as prosaic natural phenomena. Defenders of UFO research counter that knowledge of observational data, other than what is reported in the popular media, is limited in the scientific community and further study is needed.[148][149] Studies have established that the majority of UFO observations are misidentified conventional objects or natural phenomena—most commonly aircraft, balloons including sky lanterns, satellites, and astronomical objects such as meteors, bright stars and planets. A small percentage are hoaxes.[note 4]
Unidentified_flying_object	Fewer than 10% of reported sightings remain unexplained after proper investigation and therefore can be classified as unidentified in the strictest sense. According to Steven Novella, proponents of the extraterrestrial hypothesis (ETH) suggest these unexplained reports are of alien spacecraft, however the null hypothesis cannot be excluded; that these reports are simply other more prosaic phenomena that cannot be identified due to lack of complete information or due to the necessary subjectivity of the reports. Novella says that instead of accepting the null hypothesis, UFO enthusiasts tend to engage in special pleading by offering outlandish, untested explanations for the validity of the ETH, which violate Occam's razor.[150]
Unidentified_flying_object	Historically, ufology has not been considered credible in mainstream science.[151] The scientific community has generally deemed that UFO sightings are not worthy of serious investigation except as a cultural artifact.[152][112][109][153][154][155][156]
Unidentified_flying_object	Studies of UFOs rarely appear in mainstream scientific literature. When asked, some scientists and scientific organizations have pointed to the end of official governmental studies in the U.S. in December 1969, following the statement by the government scientist Edward Condon that further study of UFOs could not be justified on grounds of scientific advancement.[109][157]
Unidentified_flying_object	Nevertheless, on 14 September 2023, NASA reported the appointment, for the first time, of a NASA Director of UAP Research (known earlier as U.F.O.), identified as Mark McInerney, to scientifically, and transparently, study such occurrences.[158]
Unidentified_flying_object	Despite investigations sponsored by governments and private entities, ufology is not embraced by academia as a scientific field of study, and is instead generally considered a pseudoscience by skeptics and science educators,[159] being often included on lists of topics characterized as pseudoscience as either a partial[160] or total[161][162] pseudoscience.[163][164][165][166][167] Pseudoscience is a term that classifies arguments that are claimed to exemplify the methods and principles of science, but do not adhere to an appropriate scientific method, lack supporting evidence, plausibility, falsifiability, or otherwise lack scientific status.[168]
Unidentified_flying_object	"Jacques Vallée, a scientist and ufologist, claimed there were deficiencies in most UFO research, including government studies. He criticized the mythology and cultism often associated with UFO sightings, but despite the challenges, Vallée contended that several hundred professional scientists—a group both he and Hynek termed ""the invisible college""—continued to study UFOs quietly on their own time.[148]"
Unidentified_flying_object	UFOs have become a prevalent theme in modern culture,[148] and the social phenomena have been the subject of academic research in sociology and psychology.[151]
Unidentified_flying_object	In 2021, astronomer Avi Loeb launched The Galileo Project[173] which intends to collect and report scientific evidence of extraterrestrials or extraterrestrial technology on or near Earth via telescopic observations.[174][175][176][177]
Unidentified_flying_object	In Germany, the University of Würzburg is developing intelligent sensors that can help detect and analyze aerial objects in hopes of applying such technology to UAP.[178][179][180][181]
Unidentified_flying_object	A 2021 Gallup poll found that belief among Americans in some UFOs being extraterrestrial spacecraft grew between 2019 and 2021 from 33% to 41%. Gallup cited increased coverage in mainstream news and scrutiny from government authorities as a factor in changing attitudes towards UFOs.[182]
Unidentified_flying_object	In 2022, NASA announced a nine-month study starting in the fall to help establish a road map for investigating UAP—or for reconnaissance of the publicly available data it might use for such research.[183][184][185]
Unidentified_flying_object	Besides anecdotal visual sightings, reports sometimes include claims of other kinds of evidence, including cases studied by the military and various government agencies of different countries (such as Project Blue Book, the Condon Committee, the French GEPAN/SEPRA, and Uruguay's current Air Force study).
Unidentified_flying_object	A comprehensive scientific review of cases where physical evidence was available was carried out by the 1998 Sturrock panel, with specific examples of many of the categories listed below.
Unidentified_flying_object	"A scientifically skeptical group that has for many years offered critical analyses of UFO claims is the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry (CSI). One example is the response to local beliefs that ""extraterrestrial beings"" in UFOs were responsible for crop circles appearing in Indonesia, which the government and the National Institute of Aeronautics and Space (LAPAN) described as ""man-made"". Thomas Djamaluddin, research professor of astronomy and astrophysics at LAPAN stated: ""We have come to agree that this 'thing' cannot be scientifically proven. Scientists have put UFOs in the category of pseudoscience.""[193]"
Unidentified_flying_object	UFOs have been the subject of investigations by various governments that have provided extensive records related to the subject. Many of the most involved government-sponsored investigations ended after agencies concluded that there was no benefit to continued investigation.[194][195] These same negative conclusions also have been found in studies that were highly classified for many years, such as the UK's Flying Saucer Working Party, Project Condign, the U.S. CIA-sponsored Robertson Panel, the U.S. military investigation into the green fireballs from 1948 to 1951, and the Battelle Memorial Institute study for the USAF from 1952 to 1955 (Project Blue Book Special Report No. 14).
Unidentified_flying_object	Some public government reports have acknowledged the possibility of the physical reality of UFOs, but have stopped short of proposing extraterrestrial origins, though not dismissing the possibility entirely. Examples are the Belgian military investigation into large triangles over their airspace in 1989–1991 and the 2009 Uruguayan Air Force study conclusion (see below).
Unidentified_flying_object	"In 2007, former Arizona governor Fife Symington claimed he had seen ""a massive, delta-shaped craft silently navigate over Squaw Peak, a mountain range in Phoenix, Arizona"" in 1997.[196]
Apollo 14 astronaut Edgar Mitchell claimed he knew of senior government employees who had been involved in ""close encounters"", and because of this, he has no doubt that aliens have visited Earth.[197]"
Unidentified_flying_object	"In May 2019, The New York Times reported that American Navy fighter jets had several instances of unidentified instrumentation and tracking data while conducting exercises off the eastern seaboard of the United States from the summer of 2014 to March 2015. The Times published a cockpit instrument video that appeared to show an object moving at high speed near the ocean surface as it appeared to rotate, and objects that appeared capable of high acceleration, deceleration and maneuverability. In two separate incidents, a pilot reported his cockpit instruments locked onto and tracked objects but he was unable to see them through his helmet camera. In another encounter, flight instruments recorded an image described as a sphere encasing a cube between two jets as they flew about 100 feet apart.[198] The Pentagon officially released these videos on April 27, 2020.[199] The United States Navy has said there have been ""a number of reports of unauthorized and/or unidentified aircraft entering various military-controlled ranges and designated air space in recent years"".[200]"
Unidentified_flying_object	"According to former U.S. Navy Lieutenant Ryan Graves, UAPs spotted by US Navy crew aboard the USS Nimitz, the USS Princeton, and other carriers in 2014 prompted flight safety concerns by some Navy pilots.[201][202] Graves, described as ""one of the most vocal advocates for UAP transparency"", said the appearance of UFOs was frequent near aircraft carriers.[201] In 2019, a US Navy spokesperson, Joseph Gradisher stated that ""For safety and security concerns, the Navy and the [US Air Force] takes these reports very seriously and investigates each and every report."" and because of the sightings, the ""Navy is updating and formalising the process"" of reporting,[203][204] with the reporting process updated by 2020 [205]"
Unidentified_flying_object	"In May 2021, military pilots recalled their related encounters, along with camera and radar support, including one pilot's account noting that such incidents occurred ""every day for at least a couple of years"", according to an interview broadcast on the news program, 60 Minutes (May 16, 2021).[206][207] Science writer and skeptic Mick West suggested the image was the result of an optical effect called a bokeh which can make out of focus light sources appear triangular or pyramidal due to the shape of the aperture of some lenses.[208][209] In August, 2022, an article by West provided his detailed analysis of the video.[210]"
Unidentified_flying_object	"On June 25, 2021, U.S. Defense and intelligence officials released the nine pages Pentagon UFO Report (Preliminary Assessment: Unidentified Aerial Phenomena) on what they know about a series of unidentified flying objects that have been seen by American military pilots in the skies between 2004 and 2021.[211][212] It observed that ""UAP probably lack a single explanation"", but identified airborne clutter and foreign adversary systems as among possible objects that ""clearly pose a safety of flight issue and may pose a challenge to U.S. national security"".[213][214][215][216] The report also mentioned dangers associated with ""an increasingly cluttered air domain"" .[214] The issue of safety with commercial airlines has also been raised.[217][218] The report does not mentions extraterrestrials, but concludes that the objects found by the US military appear to be real in the majority of the 144 occurrences documented.[212] ""Most of the UAP reported probably do represent physical objects given that a majority of UAP were registered across multiple sensors, to include radar, infrared, electro-optical, weapon seekers, and visual observation"", according to the report.[212] The report also stated that ""UAP probably lack a single explanation"", and proposed five possible categories of explanation: airborne clutter, natural atmospheric phenomena, US government or industry development technology, foreign craft, and an ""Other"" category.[219] Commenting on the document, NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said that he did not think we are alone, but the UFO sightings by pilots ""may not be extraterrestrial.""[220]"
Unidentified_flying_object	In December 2021, further official governmental investigations into UAPs and related, along with annual unclassified reports presented to Congress, have been authorized and funded.[221] Some have raised concerns about the new investigations.[222]
Unidentified_flying_object	President of the United States Joe Biden in 2023 signed the Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena Disclosure Act into law as part of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2024 on December 14, 2023.[223] The 64-page amendment defined and codified 22 technical definitions related to UFOs and non-human intelligence under the law.[224]
Unidentified_flying_object	"UFOs are sometimes an element of conspiracy theories in which governments are allegedly intentionally ""covering up"" the existence of aliens by removing physical evidence of their presence or even collaborating with extraterrestrial beings. There are many versions of this story; some are exclusive, while others overlap with various other conspiracy theories."
Unidentified_flying_object	In the U.S., an opinion poll conducted in 1997 suggested that 80% of Americans believed the U.S. government was withholding such information.[225][226] Various notables have also expressed such views. Some examples are astronauts Gordon Cooper and Edgar Mitchell, Senator Barry Goldwater, Vice Admiral Roscoe H. Hillenkoetter (the first CIA director), Lord Hill-Norton (former British Chief of Defense Staff and NATO head), the 1999 French COMETA study by various French generals and aerospace experts, and Yves Sillard (former director of CNES, new director of French UFO research organization GEIPAN).[126]
Unidentified_flying_object	"In June 2023, United States Air Force officer and former intelligence official David Grusch claimed that the U.S. federal government has maintained a highly secretive UFO retrieval program since the 1940s and that the government possesses multiple spacecraft of ""non-human"" origin.[227][228]"
Unidentified_flying_object	"In May 2025, Matthew Brown, another former intelligence official, claimed elements of the US Government executive branch had conspired to prevent the US Congress from exercising its lawful powers of oversight with respect to UAP, Technology of Unknown Origin (TUO) and Non-Human Intelligence (NHI) issues. He also claimed there was a ""criminal conspiracy"" to keep the elected government of the United States ignorant of ""the profound discoveries and dire threats originating from the existence of UAP, NHI, and their technologies."" He claimed there was an Unacknowledged Special Access Program (USAP) called ""Immaculate Constellation"" that consolidated observations of UAP etc. and used ""sophisticated internal information security controls"" to enforce the detection, quarantining and compartmentalisation of UAP imagery collection incidents before they were circulated within the various branches of national and military intelligence. This was how such sightings and observations could be denied to exist by intelligence officials when questioned on it because it had been hidden to them by systems of internal secrecy they were unaware about.[229][230][231][unreliable source?]"
Unidentified_flying_object	A document written by an anonymous whistleblower (since revealed to have been authored by Matthew Brown in about 2018) was submitted to the Congressional Record at a public hearing of the House Oversight Committee in November 2024.[232]
Unidentified_flying_object	"In a later interview with Jeremy Corbell and George Knapp, released online in May 2024, Brown claimed that a secret group of people had successfully ""reverse engineered"" TUO from downed UAP and the rest of humanity had been ""left behind"".[233]"
Unidentified_flying_object	"In May 2001, a press conference was held at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C., by an organization called the Disclosure Project, featuring twenty persons including retired Air Force and FAA personnel, intelligence officers and an air traffic controller.[234][235][236][237][238][239][240] They all gave a brief account of their claims that evidence of UFOs was being suppressed and said they would be willing to testify under oath to a Congressional committee. According to a 2002 report in the Oregon Daily Emerald, Disclosure Project founder Steven M. Greer is an ""alien theorist"" who claims ""proof of government coverup"" consisting of 120 hours of testimony from various government officials on the topic of UFOs, including astronaut Gordon Cooper.[241]"

Unidentified_flying_object	"On September 27, 2010, a group of six former USAF officers and one former enlisted Air Force man held a press conference at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C., on the theme ""U.S. Nuclear Weapons Have Been Compromised by Unidentified Aerial Objects""[243] in which they claimed they had witnessed UFOs hovering near missile sites and even disarming the missiles."
Unidentified_flying_object	"From April 29 to May 3, 2013, the Paradigm Research Group held the ""Citizen Hearing on Disclosure"" at the National Press Club. The group paid former U.S. Senator Mike Gravel and former Representatives Carolyn Cheeks Kilpatrick, Roscoe Bartlett, Merrill Cook, Darlene Hooley, and Lynn Woolsey $20,000 each to hear testimony from a panel of researchers which included witnesses from military, agency, and political backgrounds.[244][245]"
Unidentified_flying_object	UFOs have been interpreted by some groups in a religious way, often influenced by the Theosophical tradition. Some Christians have interpreted UFOs as demonic entities.[246]
Unidentified_flying_object	Ufology is a neologism describing the study of UFO reports and associated evidence.[247][248] Limited institutional or scientific study has given rise to independent researchers and UFO organizations, including the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena (NICAP) in the mid-20th century and, more recently, the Mutual UFO Network (MUFON)[249] and the Center for UFO Studies (CUFOS).[250]
Unidentified_flying_object	UFOs have constituted a widespread international cultural phenomenon since the 1950s. Gallup Polls rank UFOs near the top of lists for subjects of widespread recognition. In 1973, a survey found that 95 percent of the public reported having heard of UFOs, whereas only 92 percent had heard of U.S. President Gerald Ford in a 1977 poll taken just nine months after he left the White House.[251][252]
Unidentified_flying_object	A 1996 Gallup Poll reported that 71 percent of the United States population believed the U.S. government was covering up information regarding UFOs. A 2002 Roper Poll for the Sci-Fi Channel found similar results, but with more people believing UFOs are extraterrestrial craft. In that latest poll, 56 percent thought UFOs were real craft and 48 percent that aliens had visited the Earth. Again, about 70 percent felt the government was not sharing everything it knew about UFOs or extraterrestrial life.[253][254]
Unidentified_flying_object	Another effect of the flying saucer type of UFO sightings has been Earth-made flying saucer craft in space fiction, for example the United Planets Cruiser C57D in Forbidden Planet (1956), the Jupiter 2 in Lost in Space, and the saucer section of the USS Enterprise in Star Trek. UFOs and extraterrestrials have been featured in many movies.
Unidentified_flying_object	"The intense secrecy surrounding the secret Nevada base, known as Area 51, has made it the frequent subject of conspiracy theories and a central component of UFO folklore. In July 2019, more than 2 million people replied to a joke proposal to storm Area 51 which appeared in an anonymous Facebook post.[255] Two music festivals in rural Nevada, ""AlienStock"" and ""Storm Area 51 Basecamp"", were subsequently organized to capitalize on the popularity of the original Facebook event.[256] 150 people showed up to the Area 51 entrance and attendance at the festivals was 1,500.[257]"
Ufology	Ufology, sometimes written UFOlogy (US: /juːˈfɑːlədʒi/ or UK: /juːˈfɒlədʒi/),[1] is the investigation of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) by people who believe that they may be of extraordinary origins (most frequently of extraterrestrial alien visitors).[2][3] While there are instances of government, private, and fringe science investigations of UFOs, ufology is generally regarded by skeptics and science educators as an example of pseudoscience.
Ufology	"Ufology is a neologism derived from UFO (a term coined by Edward J. Ruppelt),[4] and is derived from appending the acronym UFO with the suffix -logy (from the Ancient Greek -λογία (-logia)). Early uses of ufology include an article in Fantastic Universe (1957)[5] and a 1958 presentation for the UFO ""research organization"" The Planetary Center.[6]"
Ufology	"The roots of ufology include the ""mystery airships"" of the late 1890s, the ""foo fighters"" reported by Allied airmen during World War II, the ""ghost fliers"" of Europe and North America during the 1930s, the ""ghost rockets"" of Scandinavia (mainly Sweden) in 1946, and the Kenneth Arnold ""flying saucer"" sighting of 1947.[7][8] Media attention to the Arnold sighting helped publicize the concept of flying saucers.[9]"
Ufology	Publicity of UFOs increased after World War II, coinciding with the escalation of the Cold War and strategic concerns related to the development and detection (e.g., the Ground Observer Corps) of advanced Soviet aircraft.[7][10][11] Official, government-sponsored activities in the United States related to ufology ended in the late 1960s following the Condon Committee report and the termination of Project Blue Book.[12] Government-sponsored, UFO-related activities in other countries, including the United Kingdom,[13][14] Canada,[15] Denmark,[16] Italy,[17] and Sweden[18] also ended. An exception to this trend is France, which maintains the GEIPAN[19] program, formerly known as GEPAN (1977–1988) and SEPRA (1988–2004), operated by the French Space Agency CNES.
Ufology	On 14 September 2023, NASA reported the appointment, for the first time, of a Director of U.A.P. (known earlier as U.F.O.), identified as Mark McInerney, to scientifically and transparently study such occurrences.[20]

Ufology	"Some writers have identified social factors that contribute to the status of ufology as a pseudoscience,[31][32][33] with one study suggesting that ""any science doubt surrounding unidentified flying objects and aliens was not primarily due to the ignorance of ufologists about science, but rather a product of the respective research practices of and relations between ufology, the sciences, and government investigative bodies"".[32] One study suggests that ""the rudimentary standard of science communication attending to the extraterrestrial intelligence (ETI) hypothesis for UFOs inhibits public understanding of science, dissuades academic inquiry within the physical and social sciences, and undermines progressive space policy initiatives"".[34]"
Ufology	In 2021, astronomer Avi Loeb launched The Galileo Project[35] which intends to collect and report scientific evidence of extraterrestrials or extraterrestrial technology on or near Earth via telescopic observations.[36][37][38][39]

Ufology	In 2023, the RAND Corporation published a study reviewing 101,151 public reports of UAP sightings in the United States from 1998 to 2022.[48] The models used to conduct the analysis showed that reports of UAP sightings were less likely within 30 km of weather stations, 60 km of civilian airports, and in more–densely populated areas, while rural areas tended to have a higher rate of UAP reports. The most consistent and statistically significant finding was that reports of UAP sightings were more likely to occur within 30 km of military operations areas, where routine military training occurs.
Ufology	"Although some ufologists (e.g., Peter A. Sturrock) have proposed explicit methodological activities for the investigation of UFOs,[49] scientific UFO research is challenged by the facts that the phenomena are spatially and temporally unpredictable, are not reproducible, and lack tangible physicality.[50][51] That most UFO sightings have mundane explanations[52] limits interpretive power of ""interesting,"" extraordinary UFO-related events, with the astronomer Carl Sagan writing: ""The reliable cases are uninteresting and the interesting cases are unreliable. Unfortunately there are no cases that are both reliable and interesting.""[53]"
Ufology	The ufologists J. Allen Hynek and Jacques Vallée have each developed descriptive systems for characterizing UFO sightings and, by extension, for organizing ufology investigations.[54][55][56][unreliable source?]
Ufology	In addition to UFO sightings, certain supposedly related phenomena are of interest to some ufologists, including crop circles,[57][58] cattle mutilations,[59] anomalous materials,[60][61] alien abductions and implants.[62][63][64][65]
Ufology	Some ufologists have also promoted UFO conspiracy theories, including the Roswell Incident of 1947,[66][67][68] the Majestic 12 documents,[69] and UFO disclosure advocates.[70][71]
Ufology	"Skeptic Robert Sheaffer has accused ufology of having a ""credulity explosion,""[72] writing that ""the kind of stories generating excitement and attention in any given year would have been rejected by mainstream ufologists a few years earlier for being too outlandish.""[72] The physicist James E. McDonald also identified ""cultism"" and ""extreme...subgroups"" as negatively impacting ufology.[73]"
Ufology	"During the Cold War, ufology was synthesized with the ideas of a Trotskyist movement in South America known as Posadism. Posadism's main theorist, Juan Posadas, believed the human race must ""appeal to the beings on other planets...to intervene and collaborate with Earth's inhabitants in suppressing poverty;"" i.e., Posadas wished to collaborate with extraterrestrials to create a socialist system on Earth.[74] The adoption of this belief among Posadists, who had previously been a significant political force in South America, has been noted as a contributing factor in their decline.[75]"
Ufology	Starting in the 1940s, governmental agencies and private groups sponsored investigations, studies, and conferences related to ufology. Typically motivated by visual UFO sightings, the goals of these studies included critical evaluation of the observational evidence, attempts to resolve and identify the observed events, and the development of policy recommendations. These studies include Project Sign, Project Magnet, Project Blue Book, the Robertson Panel, and the Condon Committee in the United States, the Flying Saucer Working Party and Project Condign in Britain, GEIPAN in France, and Project Hessdalen in Norway. Private studies of UFO phenomena include those produced by the RAND Corporation in 1968,[76] Harvey Rutledge of the University of Missouri from 1973 to 1980,[77][78] and the National Press Club's Disclosure Project in 2001.[79][80][81] Additionally, the United Nations from 1977 to 1979 sponsored meetings and hearings concerning UFO sightings.[82][83] In August 2020, the United States Department of Defense established the Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Task Force to detect, analyze and catalog unidentified aerial phenomena that could potentially pose a threat to U.S. national security.[84]
Ufology	"A large number of private organizations dedicated to the study, discussion, and publicity of ufology and other UFO-related topics exist worldwide, including in the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, and Switzerland. Along with such ""pro-UFO"" groups are skeptic organizations that emphasize the pseudoscientific nature of ufology."
Ufology	"During the annual World UFO Day (2 July), ufologists and associated organizations raise public awareness of ufology to ""tell the truth about earthly visits from outer space aliens.""[85][86] The day's events include group gatherings to search for and observe UFOs.[87][88]"
Extraterrestrial_life	Extraterrestrial life, or alien life (colloquially, aliens), is life that originates from another world rather than on Earth. No extraterrestrial life has yet been scientifically or conclusively detected. Such life might range from simple forms such as prokaryotes to intelligent beings, possibly bringing forth civilizations that might be far more, or far less, advanced than humans.[1][2][3] The Drake equation speculates about the existence of sapient life elsewhere in the universe. The science of extraterrestrial life is known as astrobiology.
Extraterrestrial_life	"Speculation about inhabited worlds beyond Earth dates back to antiquity. Early Christian writers, including Augustine, discussed ideas from thinkers like Democritus and Epicurus about countless worlds in the vast universe.[4] Pre-modern writers typically assumed extraterrestrial ""worlds"" were inhabited by living beings. William Vorilong, in the 15th century, acknowledged the possibility Jesus could have visited extraterrestrial worlds to redeem their inhabitants.[4]: 26   In 1440, Nicholas of Cusa suggested Earth is a “brilliant star”; he theorized that all celestial bodies, even the Sun, could host life.[5] Descartes wrote that there were no means to prove the stars were not inhabited by ""intelligent creatures"", but their existence was a matter of speculation.[4]: 67 "
Extraterrestrial_life	In comparison to the life-abundant Earth, the vast majority of intrasolar and extrasolar planets and moons have harsh surface conditions and disparate atmospheric chemistry, or lack an atmosphere.[6] However, there are many extreme and chemically harsh ecosystems on Earth that do support forms of life and are often hypothesized to be the origin of life on Earth. Examples include life surrounding hydrothermal vents,[7] acidic hot springs,[8] and volcanic lakes,[9] as well as halophiles[10] and the deep biosphere.[11]
Extraterrestrial_life	Since the mid-20th century, researchers have searched for extraterrestrial life and intelligence. Solar system studies focus on Venus, Mars, Europa, and Titan, while exoplanet discoveries now total 6,022 confirmed planets in 4,490 systems as of October 2025. Depending on the category of search, methods range from analysis of telescope and specimen data[12] to radios used to detect and transmit interstellar communication.[13] Interstellar travel remains largely hypothetical, with only the Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 probes confirmed to have entered the interstellar medium. The concept of extraterrestrial life, especially intelligent life, has greatly influenced culture and fiction. A key debate centers on contacting extraterrestrial intelligence: some advocate active attempts, while others warn it could be risky, given humanity’s history of exploiting less advanced societies.[14][15]
Extraterrestrial_life	Initially, after the Big Bang, the universe was too hot to allow life. It is estimated that the temperature of the universe was around 10 billion Kelvin at the one-second mark.[16] Roughly 15 million years later, it cooled to temperate levels, though the elements of organic life were yet nonexistent. The only freely available elements at that point were hydrogen and helium. Carbon and oxygen (and later, water) would not appear until 50 million years later, created through stellar fusion. At that point, the difficulty for life to appear was not the temperature, but the scarcity of free heavy elements.[17] Planetary systems emerged, and the first organic compounds may have formed in the protoplanetary disk of dust grains that would eventually create rocky planets like Earth. Although Earth was in a molten state after its birth and may have burned any organics that fell on it, it would have been more receptive once it cooled down.[18] Once the right conditions on Earth were met, life started by a chemical process known as abiogenesis. Alternatively, life may have formed less frequently, then spread—by meteoroids, for example—between habitable planets in a process called panspermia.[19][20]
Extraterrestrial_life	During most of its stellar evolution, stars combine hydrogen nuclei to make helium nuclei by stellar fusion, and the comparatively lighter weight of helium allows the star to release the extra energy. The process continues until the star uses all of its available fuel, with the speed of consumption being related to the size of the star. During its last stages, stars start combining helium nuclei to form carbon nuclei. The larger stars can further combine carbon nuclei to create oxygen and silicon, oxygen into neon and sulfur, and so on until iron. Ultimately, the star blows much of its content back into the stellar medium, where it would join clouds that would eventually become new generations of stars and planets. Many of those materials are the raw components of life on Earth. As this process takes place in all the universe, said materials are ubiquitous in the cosmos and not a rarity from the Solar System.[21]
Extraterrestrial_life	Earth is a planet in the Solar System, a planetary system formed by a star at the center, the Sun, and the objects that orbit it: other planets, moons, asteroids, and comets. The sun is part of the Milky Way, a galaxy. The Milky Way is part of the Local Group, a galaxy group that is in turn part of the Laniakea Supercluster. The universe is composed of all similar structures in existence.[22] The immense distances between celestial objects are a difficulty for studying extraterrestrial life. So far, humans have only set foot on the Moon and sent robotic probes to other planets and moons in the Solar System. Although probes can withstand conditions that may be lethal to humans, the distances cause time delays: the New Horizons took nine years after launch to reach Pluto.[23] No probe has ever reached extrasolar planetary systems. The Voyager 2 left the Solar System at a speed of 50,000 kilometers per hour; if it headed towards the Alpha Centauri system, the closest one to Earth at 4.4 light years, it would reach it in 100,000 years. Under current technology, such systems can only be studied by telescopes, which have limitations.[23] It is estimated that dark matter has a larger amount of combined matter than stars and gas clouds, but as it plays no role in the stellar evolution of stars and planets, it is usually not taken into account by astrobiology.[24]
Extraterrestrial_life	"There is an area around a star, the circumstellar habitable zone or ""Goldilocks zone"", wherein water may be at the right temperature to exist in liquid form at a planetary surface. This area is neither too close to the star, where water would become steam, nor too far away, where water would be frozen as ice. However, although useful as an approximation, planetary habitability is complex and defined by several factors. Being in the habitable zone is not enough for a planet to be habitable, not even to actually have such liquid water. Venus is located in the solar system's habitable zone, but does not have liquid water because of the conditions of its atmosphere. Jovian planets or gas giants are not considered habitable even if they orbit close enough to their stars as hot Jupiters, due to crushing atmospheric pressures.[25] The actual distances for the habitable zones vary according to the type of star, and even the solar activity of each specific star influences the local habitability. The type of star also defines the time the habitable zone will exist, as its presence and limits will change along with the star's stellar evolution.[26]"
Extraterrestrial_life	The Big Bang occurred 13.8 billion years ago, the Solar System was formed 4.6 billion years ago, and the first hominids appeared 6 million years ago. Life on other planets may have started, evolved, given birth to extraterrestrial intelligences, and perhaps even faced a planetary extinction event millions or billions of years ago. When considered from a cosmic perspective, the brief times of existence of Earth's species may suggest that extraterrestrial life may be equally fleeting under such a scale.[27]
Extraterrestrial_life	"During a period of about 7 million years, from about 10 to 17 million years after the Big Bang, the background temperature was between 373 and 273 K (100 and 0 °C; 212 and 32 °F), allowing the possibility of liquid water if any planets existed. Avi Loeb (2014) speculated that primitive life might in principle have appeared during this window, which he called ""the Habitable Epoch of the Early Universe"".[28][29]"
Extraterrestrial_life	Life on Earth is quite ubiquitous across the planet and has adapted over time to almost all the available environments in it, extremophiles and the deep biosphere thrive at even the most hostile ones. As a result, it is inferred that life in other celestial bodies may be equally adaptive. However, the origin of life is unrelated to its ease of adaptation and may have stricter requirements. A celestial body may not have any life on it, even if it were habitable.[30]
Extraterrestrial_life	It is unclear if life, and more importantly,  intelligent life in the cosmos is ubiquitous or rare. The hypothesis of ubiquitous extraterrestrial life relies on three main ideas. The first one, the size of the universe, allows for plenty of planets to have a similar habitability to Earth, and the age of the universe gives enough time for a long process analog to the history of Earth to happen there. The second is that the substances that make life, such as carbon and water, are ubiquitous in the universe. The third is that the physical laws are universal, which means that the forces that would facilitate or prevent the existence of life would be the same ones as on Earth.[31] According to this argument, made by scientists such as Carl Sagan and Stephen Hawking, it would be improbable for life not to exist somewhere else other than Earth.[32][33] This argument is embodied in the Copernican principle, which states that Earth does not occupy a unique position in the Universe, and the mediocrity principle, which states that there is nothing special about life on Earth.[34]
Extraterrestrial_life	Other authors consider instead that life in the cosmos, or at least multicellular life, may actually be rare. The Rare Earth hypothesis maintains that life on Earth is possible because of a series of factors that range from the location in the galaxy and the configuration of the Solar System to local characteristics of the planet, and that it is unlikely that another planet simultaneously meets all such requirements. The proponents of this hypothesis consider that very little evidence suggests the existence of extraterrestrial life and that, at this point, it is just a desired result and not a reasonable scientific explanation for any gathered data.[35][36]
Extraterrestrial_life	In 1961, astronomer and astrophysicist Frank Drake devised the Drake equation as a way to stimulate scientific dialogue at a meeting on the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI).[37][38] The Drake equation is a probabilistic argument used to estimate the number of active, communicative extraterrestrial civilizations in the Milky Way galaxy. The Drake equation is:[39]: xix 
Extraterrestrial_life	Drake's proposed estimates are as follows, but numbers on the right side of the equation are agreed as speculative and open to substitution:
Extraterrestrial_life	The Drake equation has proved controversial since, although it is written as a math equation, none of its values were known at the time. Although some values may eventually be measured, others are based on social sciences and are not knowable by their very nature.[41] This does not allow one to make noteworthy conclusions from the equation.[42]
Extraterrestrial_life	Based on observations from the Hubble Space Telescope, there are nearly 2 trillion galaxies in the observable universe.[43] It is estimated that at least ten percent of all Sun-like stars have a system of planets.[44] In other words, there are 6.25×1018 stars with planets orbiting them in the observable universe. Even if it is assumed that only one out of a billion of these stars has planets supporting life, there would be some 6.25 billion life-supporting planetary systems in the observable universe. A 2013 study based on results from the Kepler spacecraft estimated that the Milky Way contains at least as many planets as it does stars, resulting in 100–400 billion exoplanets.[45][46] The Nebular hypothesis that explains the formation of the Solar System and other planetary systems would suggest that those can have several configurations, and not all of them may have rocky planets within the habitable zone.[47]
Extraterrestrial_life	The apparent contradiction between high estimates of the probability of the existence of extraterrestrial civilisations and the lack of evidence for such civilisations is known as the Fermi paradox.[48] Dennis W. Sciama claimed that life's existence in the universe depends on various fundamental constants. Zhi-Wei Wang and Samuel L. Braunstein suggest that a random universe capable of supporting life is likely to be just barely able to do so, giving a potential explanation to the Fermi paradox.[49]
Extraterrestrial_life	If extraterrestrial life exists, it could range from simple microorganisms and multicellular organisms similar to animals or plants, to complex alien intelligences akin to humans. When scientists talk about extraterrestrial life, they consider all those types. Although it is possible that extraterrestrial life may have other configurations, scientists use the hierarchy of lifeforms from Earth for simplicity, as it is the only one known to exist.[50]
Extraterrestrial_life	The first basic requirement for life is an environment with non-equilibrium thermodynamics, which means that the thermodynamic equilibrium must be broken by a source of energy. The traditional sources of energy in the cosmos are the stars, such as for life on Earth, which depends on the energy of the sun. However, there are other alternative energy sources, such as volcanoes, plate tectonics, and hydrothermal vents. There are ecosystems on Earth in deep areas of the ocean that do not receive sunlight, and take energy from black smokers instead.[51] Magnetic fields and radioactivity have also been proposed as sources of energy, although they would be less efficient ones.[52]
Extraterrestrial_life	Life on Earth requires water in a liquid state as a solvent in which biochemical reactions take place. It is highly unlikely that an abiogenesis process can start within a gaseous or solid medium: the atom speeds, either too fast or too slow, make it difficult for specific ones to meet and start chemical reactions. A liquid medium also allows the transport of nutrients and substances required for metabolism.[53] Sufficient quantities of carbon and other elements, along with water, might enable the formation of living organisms on terrestrial planets with a chemical make-up and temperature range similar to that of Earth.[54][55] Life based on ammonia rather than water has been suggested as an alternative, though this solvent appears less suitable than water. It is also conceivable that there are forms of life whose solvent is a liquid hydrocarbon, such as methane, ethane or propane.[56]
Extraterrestrial_life	Another unknown aspect of potential extraterrestrial life would be the chemical elements that would compose it. Life on Earth is largely composed of carbon, but there could be other hypothetical types of biochemistry. A replacement for carbon would need to be able to create complex molecules, store information required for evolution, and be freely available in the medium. To create DNA, RNA, or a close analog, such an element should be able to bind its atoms with many others, creating complex and stable molecules. It should be able to create at least three covalent bonds: two for making long strings and at least a third to add new links and allow for diverse information. Only nine elements meet this requirement: boron, nitrogen, phosphorus, arsenic, antimony (three bonds), carbon, silicon, germanium and tin (four bonds). As for abundance, carbon, nitrogen, and silicon are the most abundant ones in the universe, far more than the others. On Earth's crust the most abundant of those elements is silicon, in the Hydrosphere it is carbon and in the atmosphere, it is carbon and nitrogen. Silicon, however, has disadvantages over carbon. The molecules formed with silicon atoms are less stable, and more vulnerable to acids, oxygen, and light. An ecosystem of silicon-based lifeforms would require very low temperatures, high atmospheric pressure, an atmosphere devoid of oxygen, and a solvent other than water. The low temperatures required would add an extra problem, the difficulty to kickstart a process of abiogenesis to create life in the first place.[57] Norman Horowitz, head of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory bioscience section for the Mariner and Viking missions from 1965 to 1976 considered that the great versatility of the carbon atom makes it the element most likely to provide solutions, even exotic solutions, to the problems of survival of life on other planets.[58]  However, he also considered that the conditions found on Mars were incompatible with carbon based life. 
Extraterrestrial_life	Even if extraterrestrial life is based on carbon and uses water as a solvent, like Earth life, it may still have a radically different biochemistry.  Life is generally considered to be a product of natural selection.  It has been proposed that to undergo natural selection a living entity must have the capacity to replicate itself, the capacity to avoid damage/decay, and the capacity to acquire and process resources in support of the first two capacities.[59] Life on Earth may have started with an RNA world and later evolved to its current form, where some of the RNA tasks were transferred to DNA and proteins. Extraterrestrial life may still be stuck using RNA, or evolve into other configurations. It is unclear if our biochemistry is the most efficient one that could be generated, or which elements would follow a similar pattern.[60] However, it is likely that, even if cells had a different composition to those from Earth, they would still have a cell membrane. Life on Earth jumped from prokaryotes to eukaryotes and from unicellular organisms to multicellular organisms through evolution. So far no alternative process to achieve such a result has been conceived, even if hypothetical. Evolution requires life to be divided into individual organisms, and no alternative organisation has been satisfactorily proposed either. At the basic level, membranes define the limit of a cell, between it and its environment, while remaining partially open to exchange energy and resources with it.[61]
Extraterrestrial_life	The evolution from simple cells to eukaryotes, and from them to multicellular lifeforms, is not guaranteed. The Cambrian explosion took place thousands of millions of years after the origin of life, and its causes are not fully known yet. On the other hand, the jump to multicellularity took place several times, which suggests that it could be a case of convergent evolution, and so likely to take place on other planets as well. Palaeontologist Simon Conway Morris considers that convergent evolution would lead to kingdoms similar to our plants and animals, and that many features are likely to develop in alien animals as well, such as bilateral symmetry, limbs, digestive systems and heads with sensory organs.[62] Scientists from the University of Oxford analysed it from the perspective of evolutionary theory and wrote in a study in the International Journal of Astrobiology that aliens may be similar to humans.[63] The planetary context would also have an influence: a planet with higher gravity would have smaller animals, and other types of stars can lead to non-green photosynthesizers. The amount of energy available would also affect biodiversity, as an ecosystem sustained by black smokers or hydrothermal vents would have less energy available than those sustained by a star's light and heat, and so its lifeforms would not grow beyond a certain complexity.[62] There is also research in assessing the capacity of life for developing intelligence. It has been suggested that this capacity arises with the number of potential niches a planet contains, and that the complexity of life itself is reflected in the information density of planetary environments, which in turn can be computed from its niches.[64]
Extraterrestrial_life	It is common knowledge that the conditions on other planets in the solar system, in addition to the many galaxies outside of the Milky Way galaxy, are very harsh and seem to be too extreme to harbor any life.[65] The environmental conditions on these planets can have intense UV radiation paired with extreme temperatures, lack of water,[66] and much more that can lead to conditions that don't seem to favor the creation or maintenance of extraterrestrial life. However, there has been much historical evidence that some of the earliest and most basic forms of life on Earth originated in some extreme environments[67] that seem unlikely to have harbored life at least at one point in Earth's history. Fossil evidence as well as many historical theories backed up by years of research and studies have marked environments like hydrothermal vents or acidic hot springs as some of the first places that life could have originated on Earth.[68] These environments can be considered extreme when compared to the typical ecosystems that the majority of life on Earth now inhabit, as hydrothermal vents are scorching hot due to the magma escaping from the Earth's mantle and meeting the much colder oceanic water. Even in today's world, there can be a diverse population of bacteria found inhabiting the area surrounding these hydrothermal vents[69] which can suggest that some form of life can be supported even in the harshest of environments like the other planets in the solar system.
Extraterrestrial_life	The aspects of these harsh environments that make them ideal for the origin of life on Earth, as well as the possibility of creation of life on other planets, is the chemical reactions forming spontaneously. For example, the hydrothermal vents found on the ocean floor are known to support many chemosynthetic processes[7] which allow organisms to utilize energy through reduced chemical compounds that fix carbon.[69] In return, these reactions will allow for organisms to live in relatively low oxygenated environments while maintaining enough energy to support themselves. The early Earth environment was reducing[70] and therefore, these carbon fixing compounds were necessary for the survival and possible origin of life on Earth. With the little amount of information that scientists have found regarding the atmosphere on other planets in the Milky Way galaxy and beyond, the atmospheres are most likely reducing or with very low oxygen levels,[71] especially when compared with Earth's atmosphere. If there were the necessary elements and ions on these planets, the same carbon fixing, reduced chemical compounds occurring around hydrothermal vents could also occur on these planets' surfaces and possibly result in the origin of extraterrestrial life.
Extraterrestrial_life	The Solar System has a wide variety of planets, dwarf planets, and moons, and each one is studied for its potential to host life. Each one has its own specific conditions that may benefit or harm life. So far, the only lifeforms found are those from Earth. No extraterrestrial intelligence other than humans exists or has ever existed within the Solar System.[72] Astrobiologist Mary Voytek points out that it would be unlikely to find large ecosystems, as they would have already been detected by now.[25]
Extraterrestrial_life	The inner Solar System is likely devoid of life. However, Venus is still of interest to astrobiologists, as it is a terrestrial planet that was likely similar to Earth in its early stages and developed in a different way. There is a greenhouse effect, the surface is the hottest in the Solar System, sulfuric acid clouds, all surface liquid water is lost, and it has a thick carbon-dioxide atmosphere with huge pressure.[73] Comparing both helps to understand the precise differences that lead to beneficial or harmful conditions for life. And despite the conditions against life on Venus, there are suspicions that microbial life-forms may still survive in high-altitude clouds.[25]
Extraterrestrial_life	Mars is a cold and almost airless desert, inhospitable to life. However, recent studies revealed that water on Mars used to be quite abundant, forming rivers, lakes, and perhaps even oceans. Mars may have been habitable back then, and life on Mars may have been possible. But when the planetary core ceased to generate a magnetic field, solar winds removed the atmosphere and the planet became vulnerable to solar radiation. Ancient life-forms may still have left fossilised remains, and microbes may still survive deep underground.[25]
Extraterrestrial_life	As mentioned, the gas giants and ice giants are unlikely to contain life. The most distant solar system bodies, found in the Kuiper Belt and outwards, are locked in permanent deep-freeze, but cannot be ruled out completely.[25]
Extraterrestrial_life	Although the giant planets themselves are highly unlikely to have life, there is much hope to find it on moons orbiting these planets. Europa, from the Jovian system, has a subsurface ocean below a thick layer of ice. Ganymede and Callisto also have subsurface oceans, but life is less likely in them because water is sandwiched between layers of solid ice. Europa would have contact between the ocean and the rocky surface, which helps the chemical reactions. It may be difficult to dig so deep in order to study those oceans, though. Enceladus, a tiny moon of Saturn with another subsurface ocean, may not need to be dug, as it releases water to space in eruption columns. The space probe Cassini flew inside one of these, but could not make a full study because NASA did not expect this phenomenon and did not equip the probe to study ocean water. Still, Cassini detected complex organic molecules, salts, evidence of hydrothermal activity, hydrogen, and methane.[25]
Extraterrestrial_life	Titan is the only celestial body in the Solar System besides Earth that has liquid bodies on the surface. It has rivers, lakes, and rain of hydrocarbons, methane, and ethane, and even a cycle similar to Earth's water cycle. This special context encourages speculations about lifeforms with different biochemistry, but the cold temperatures would make such chemistry take place at a very slow pace. Water is rock-solid on the surface, but Titan does have a subsurface water ocean like several other moons. However, it is of such a great depth that it would be very difficult to access it for study.[25]
Extraterrestrial_life	The science that searches and studies life in the universe, both on Earth and elsewhere, is called astrobiology. With the study of Earth's life, the only known form of life, astrobiology seeks to study how life starts and evolves and the requirements for its continuous existence. This helps to determine what to look for when searching for life in other celestial bodies. This is a complex area of study, and uses the combined perspectives of several scientific disciplines, such as astronomy, biology, chemistry, geology, oceanography, and atmospheric sciences.[74]
Extraterrestrial_life	The scientific search for extraterrestrial life is being carried out both directly and indirectly. As of September 2017[update], 3,667 exoplanets in 2,747 systems have been identified, and other planets and moons in the Solar System hold the potential for hosting primitive life such as microorganisms. As of 8 February 2021, an updated status of studies considering the possible detection of lifeforms on Venus (via phosphine) and Mars (via methane) was reported.[75]
Extraterrestrial_life	Scientists search for biosignatures within the Solar System by studying planetary surfaces and examining meteorites. Some claim to have identified evidence that microbial life has existed on Mars.[78][79][80][81] In 1996, a controversial report stated that structures resembling nanobacteria were discovered in a meteorite, ALH84001, formed of rock ejected from Mars.[78][79] Although all the unusual properties of the meteorite were eventually explained as the result of inorganic processes, the controversy over its discovery laid the groundwork for the development of astrobiology.[78]
Extraterrestrial_life	An experiment on the two Viking Mars landers reported gas emissions from heated Martian soil samples that some scientists argue are consistent with the presence of living microorganisms.[82] Lack of corroborating evidence from other experiments on the same samples suggests that a non-biological reaction is a more likely hypothesis.[82][83][84][85]
Extraterrestrial_life	In February 2005 NASA scientists reported they may have found some evidence of extraterrestrial life on Mars.[86] The two scientists, Carol Stoker and Larry Lemke of NASA's Ames Research Center, based their claim on methane signatures found in Mars's atmosphere resembling the methane production of some forms of primitive life on Earth, as well as on their own study of primitive life near the Rio Tinto river in Spain. NASA officials soon distanced NASA from the scientists' claims, and Stoker herself backed off from her initial assertions.[87]
Extraterrestrial_life	In November 2011, NASA launched the Mars Science Laboratory that landed the Curiosity rover on Mars. It is designed to assess the past and present habitability on Mars using a variety of scientific instruments. The rover landed on Mars at Gale Crater in August 2012.[88][89]
Extraterrestrial_life	A group of scientists at Cornell University started a catalog of microorganisms, with the way each one reacts to sunlight. The goal is to help with the search for similar organisms in exoplanets, as the starlight reflected by planets rich in such organisms would have a specific spectrum, unlike that of starlight reflected from lifeless planets. If Earth was studied from afar with this system, it would reveal a shade of green, as a result of the abundance of plants with photosynthesis.[90]
Extraterrestrial_life	"In August 2011, NASA studied meteorites found on Antarctica, finding adenine, guanine, hypoxanthine and xanthine. Adenine and guanine are components of DNA, and the others are used in other biological processes. The studies ruled out pollution of the meteorites on Earth, as those components would not be freely available the way they were found in the samples. This discovery suggests that several organic molecules that serve as building blocks of life may be generated within asteroids and comets.[91][92] In October 2011, scientists reported that cosmic dust contains complex organic compounds (""amorphous organic solids with a mixed aromatic-aliphatic structure"") that could be created naturally, and rapidly, by stars.[93][94][95] It is still unclear if those compounds played a role in the creation of life on Earth, but Sun Kwok, of the University of Hong Kong, thinks so. ""If this is the case, life on Earth may have had an easier time getting started as these organics can serve as basic ingredients for life.""[93]"
Extraterrestrial_life	In August 2012, and in a world first, astronomers at Copenhagen University reported the detection of a specific sugar molecule, glycolaldehyde, in a distant star system. The molecule was found around the protostellar binary IRAS 16293-2422, which is located 400 light years from Earth.[96] Glycolaldehyde is needed to form ribonucleic acid, or RNA, which is similar in function to DNA. This finding suggests that complex organic molecules may form in stellar systems prior to the formation of planets, eventually arriving on young planets early in their formation.[97]
Extraterrestrial_life	"In December 2023, astronomers reported the first time discovery, in the plumes of Enceladus, moon of the planet Saturn, of hydrogen cyanide, a possible chemical essential for life[98] as we know it, as well as other organic molecules, some of which are yet to be better identified and understood. According to the researchers, ""these [newly discovered] compounds could potentially support extant microbial communities or drive complex organic synthesis leading to the origin of life.""[99][100]"
Extraterrestrial_life	Although most searches are focused on the biology of extraterrestrial life, an extraterrestrial intelligence capable enough to develop a civilization may be detectable by other means as well. Technology may generate technosignatures, effects on the native planet that may not be caused by natural causes. There are three main types of techno-signatures considered: interstellar communications, effects on the atmosphere, and planetary-sized structures such as Dyson spheres.[101]
Extraterrestrial_life	Organizations such as the SETI Institute search the cosmos for potential forms of communication. They started with radio waves, and now search for laser pulses as well. The challenge for this search is that there are natural sources of such signals as well, such as gamma-ray bursts and supernovae, and the difference between a natural signal and an artificial one would be in its specific patterns. Astronomers intend to use artificial intelligence for this, as it can manage large amounts of data and is devoid of biases and preconceptions.[101] Besides, even if there is an advanced extraterrestrial civilization, there is no guarantee that it is transmitting radio communications in the direction of Earth. The length of time required for a signal to travel across space means that a potential answer may arrive decades or centuries after the initial message.[102]
Extraterrestrial_life	The atmosphere of Earth is rich in nitrogen dioxide as a result of air pollution, which can be detectable. The natural abundance of carbon, which is also relatively reactive, makes it likely to be a basic component of the development of a potential extraterrestrial technological civilization, as it is on Earth. Fossil fuels may likely be generated and used on such worlds as well. The abundance of chlorofluorocarbons in the atmosphere can also be a clear technosignature, considering their role in ozone depletion. Light pollution may be another technosignature, as multiple lights on the night side of a rocky planet can be a sign of advanced technological development. However, modern telescopes are not strong enough to study exoplanets with the required level of detail to perceive it.[101]
Extraterrestrial_life	The Kardashev scale proposes that a civilization may eventually start consuming energy directly from its local star. This would require giant structures built next to it, called Dyson spheres. Those speculative structures would cause an excess infrared radiation, that telescopes may notice. The infrared radiation is typical of young stars, surrounded by dusty protoplanetary disks that will eventually form planets. An older star such as the Sun would have no natural reason to have excess infrared radiation.[101] The presence of heavy elements in a star's light-spectrum is another potential biosignature; such elements would (in theory) be found if the star were being used as an incinerator/repository for nuclear waste products.[103]
Extraterrestrial_life	Some astronomers search for extrasolar planets that may be conducive to life, narrowing the search to terrestrial planets within the habitable zones of their stars.[104][105] Since 1992, over four thousand exoplanets have been discovered (6,128 planets in 4,584 planetary systems including 1,017 multiple planetary systems as of 30 October 2025).[106]
Extraterrestrial_life	The extrasolar planets so far discovered range in size from that of terrestrial planets similar to Earth's size to that of gas giants larger than Jupiter.[106] The number of observed exoplanets is expected to increase greatly in the coming years.[107][better source needed] The Kepler space telescope has also detected a few thousand[108][109] candidate planets,[110][111] of which about 11% may be false positives.[112]
Extraterrestrial_life	"There is at least one planet on average per star.[113] About 1 in 5 Sun-like stars[a] have an ""Earth-sized""[b] planet in the habitable zone,[c] with the nearest expected to be within 12 light-years distance from Earth.[114][115] Assuming 200 billion stars in the Milky Way,[d] that would be 11 billion potentially habitable Earth-sized planets in the Milky Way, rising to 40 billion if red dwarfs are included.[116] The rogue planets in the Milky Way possibly number in the trillions.[117]"
Extraterrestrial_life	The nearest known exoplanet is Proxima Centauri b, located 4.2 light-years (1.3 pc) from Earth in the southern constellation of Centaurus.[118]
Extraterrestrial_life	As of March 2014[update], the least massive exoplanet known is PSR B1257+12 A, which is about twice the mass of the Moon. The most massive planet listed on the NASA Exoplanet Archive is DENIS-P J082303.1−491201 b,[119][120] about 29 times the mass of Jupiter, although according to most definitions of a planet, it is too massive to be a planet and may be a brown dwarf instead. Almost all of the planets detected so far are within the Milky Way, but there have also been a few possible detections of extragalactic planets. The study of planetary habitability also considers a wide range of other factors in determining the suitability of a planet for hosting life.[12]
Extraterrestrial_life	One sign that a planet probably already contains life is the presence of an atmosphere with significant amounts of oxygen, since that gas is highly reactive and generally would not last long without constant replenishment. This replenishment occurs on Earth through photosynthetic organisms. One way to analyse the atmosphere of an exoplanet is through spectrography when it transits its star, though this might only be feasible with dim stars like white dwarfs.[121]
Extraterrestrial_life	The modern concept of extraterrestrial life is based on assumptions that were not commonplace during the early days of astronomy. The first explanations for the celestial objects seen in the night sky were based on mythology. Scholars from Ancient Greece were the first to consider that the universe is inherently understandable and rejected explanations based on supernatural incomprehensible forces, such as the myth of the Sun being pulled across the sky in the chariot of Apollo. They had not developed the scientific method yet and based their ideas on pure thought and speculation, but they developed precursor ideas to it, such as that explanations had to be discarded if they contradict observable facts. The discussions of those Greek scholars established many of the pillars that would eventually lead to the idea of extraterrestrial life, such as Earth being round and not flat. The cosmos was first structured in a geocentric model that considered that the sun and all other celestial bodies revolve around Earth. However, they did not consider them as worlds. In Greek understanding, the world was composed by both Earth and the celestial objects with noticeable movements. Anaximander thought that the cosmos was made from apeiron, a substance that created the world, and that the world would eventually return to the cosmos.
Extraterrestrial_life	Eventually two groups emerged, the atomists that thought that matter at both Earth and the cosmos was equally made of small atoms of the classical elements (earth, water, fire and air), and the Aristotelians who thought that those elements were exclusive of Earth and that the cosmos was made of a fifth one, the aether. Atomist Epicurus thought that the processes that created the world, its animals and plants should have created other worlds elsewhere, along with their own animals and plants. Aristotle thought instead that all the earth element naturally fell towards the center of the universe, and that would make it impossible for other planets to exist elsewhere. Under that reasoning, Earth was not only in the center, it was also the only planet in the universe.[122]
Extraterrestrial_life	"Cosmic pluralism, the plurality of worlds, or simply pluralism, describes the philosophical belief in numerous ""worlds"" in addition to Earth, which might harbor extraterrestrial life. The earliest recorded assertion of extraterrestrial human life is found in ancient scriptures of Jainism. There are multiple ""worlds"" mentioned in Jain scriptures that support human life. These include, among others, Bharat Kshetra, Mahavideh Kshetra, Airavat Kshetra, and Hari kshetra.[123][124][125] Medieval Muslim writers like Fakhr al-Din al-Razi and Muhammad al-Baqir supported cosmic pluralism on the basis of the Qur'an.[126] Chaucer's poem The House of Fame engaged in medieval thought experiments that postulated the plurality of worlds.[127] However, those ideas about other worlds were different from the current knowledge about the structure of the universe, and did not postulate the existence of planetary systems other than the Solar System. When those authors talk about other worlds, they talk about places located at the center of their own systems, and with their own stellar vaults and cosmos surrounding them.[128]"
Extraterrestrial_life	The Greek ideas and the disputes between atomists and Aristotelians outlived the fall of the Greek empire. The Great Library of Alexandria compiled information about it, part of which was translated by Islamic scholars and thus survived the end of the Library. Baghdad combined the knowledge of the Greeks, the Indians, the Chinese and its own scholars, and the knowledge expanded through the Byzantine Empire. From there it eventually returned to Europe by the time of the Middle Ages. However, as the Greek atomist doctrine held that the world was created by random movements of atoms, with no need for a creator deity, it became associated with atheism, and the dispute intertwined with religious ones.[129] Still, the Church did not react to those topics in a homogeneous way, and there were stricter and more permissive views within the church itself.[130]
Extraterrestrial_life	The first known mention of the term 'panspermia' was in the writings of the 5th-century BC Greek philosopher Anaxagoras. He proposed the idea that life exists everywhere.[131]
Extraterrestrial_life	By the time of the late Middle Ages there were many known inaccuracies in the geocentric model, but it was kept in use because naked eye observations provided limited data. Nicolaus Copernicus started the Copernican Revolution by proposing that the planets revolve around the sun rather than Earth. His proposal had little acceptance at first because, as he kept the assumption that orbits were perfect circles, his model led to as many inaccuracies as the geocentric one. Tycho Brahe improved the available data with naked-eye observatories, which worked with highly complex sextants and quadrants. Tycho could not make sense of his observations, but Johannes Kepler did: orbits were not perfect circles, but ellipses. This knowledge benefited the Copernican model, which worked now almost perfectly. The invention of the telescope a short time later, perfected by Galileo Galilei, clarified the final doubts, and the paradigm shift was completed.[132] Under this new understanding, the notion of extraterrestrial life became feasible: if Earth is but just a planet orbiting around a star, there may be planets similar to Earth elsewhere. The astronomical study of distant bodies also proved that physical laws are the same elsewhere in the universe as on Earth, with nothing making the planet truly special.[133]
Extraterrestrial_life	"The new ideas were met with resistance from the Catholic church. Galileo was tried for the heliocentric model, which was considered heretical, and forced to recant it.[134] The best-known early-modern proponent of ideas of extraterrestrial life was the Italian philosopher Giordano Bruno, who argued in the 16th century for an infinite universe in which every star is surrounded by its own planetary system. Bruno wrote that other worlds ""have no less virtue nor a nature different to that of our earth"" and, like Earth, ""contain animals and inhabitants"".[135] Bruno's belief in the plurality of worlds was one of the charges leveled against him by the Venetian Holy Inquisition, which tried and executed him.[136]"
Extraterrestrial_life	The heliocentric model was further strengthened by the postulation of the theory of gravity by Sir Isaac Newton. This theory provided the mathematics that explains the motions of all things in the universe, including planetary orbits. By this point, the geocentric model was definitely discarded. By this time, the use of the scientific method had become a standard, and new discoveries were expected to provide evidence and rigorous mathematical explanations. Science also took a deeper interest in the mechanics of natural phenomena, trying to explain not just the way nature works but also the reasons for working that way.[137]
Extraterrestrial_life	There was very little actual discussion about extraterrestrial life before this point, as the Aristotelian ideas remained influential while geocentrism was still accepted. When it was finally proved wrong, it not only meant that Earth was not the center of the universe, but also that the lights seen in the sky were not just lights, but physical objects. The notion that life may exist in them as well soon became an ongoing topic of discussion, although one with no practical ways to investigate.[138]
Extraterrestrial_life	"The possibility of extraterrestrials remained a widespread speculation as scientific discovery accelerated. William Herschel, the discoverer of Uranus, was one of many 18th–19th-century astronomers who believed that the Solar System is populated by alien life. Other scholars of the period who championed ""cosmic pluralism"" included Immanuel Kant and Benjamin Franklin. At the height of the Enlightenment, even the Sun and Moon were considered candidates for extraterrestrial inhabitants.[139][140]"
Extraterrestrial_life	Speculation about life on Mars increased in the late 19th century, following telescopic observation of apparent Martian canals – which soon, however, turned out to be optical illusions.[141] Despite this, in 1895, American astronomer Percival Lowell published his book Mars, followed by Mars and its Canals in 1906, proposing that the canals were the work of a long-gone civilisation.[142]
Extraterrestrial_life	Spectroscopic analysis of Mars's atmosphere began in earnest in 1894, when U.S. astronomer William Wallace Campbell showed that neither water nor oxygen was present in the Martian atmosphere.[143] By 1909 better telescopes and the best perihelic opposition of Mars since 1877 conclusively put an end to the canal hypothesis.[144]
Extraterrestrial_life	"As a consequence of the belief in the spontaneous generation there was little thought about the conditions of each celestial body: it was simply assumed that life would thrive anywhere. This theory was disproved by Louis Pasteur in the 19th century. Popular belief in thriving alien civilisations elsewhere in the solar system still remained strong until Mariner 4 and Mariner 9 provided close images of Mars, which debunked forever the idea of the existence of Martians and decreased the previous expectations of finding alien life in general.[145] The end of the spontaneous generation belief forced investigation into the origin of life. Although abiogenesis is the more accepted theory, a number of authors reclaimed the term ""panspermia"" and proposed that life was brought to Earth from elsewhere.[131] Some of those authors are Jöns Jacob Berzelius (1834),[146] Kelvin (1871),[147] Hermann von Helmholtz (1879)[148] and, somewhat later, by Svante Arrhenius (1903).[149]"
Extraterrestrial_life	The science fiction genre, although not so named during the time, developed during the late 19th century. The expansion of the genre of extraterrestrials in fiction influenced the popular perception over the real-life topic, making people eager to jump to conclusions about the discovery of aliens. Science marched at a slower pace, some discoveries fueled expectations and others dashed excessive hopes. For example, with the advent of telescopes, most structures seen on the Moon or Mars were immediately attributed to Selenites or Martians, and later ones (such as more powerful telescopes) revealed that all such discoveries were natural features.[136] A famous case is the Cydonia region of Mars, first imaged by the Viking 1 orbiter. The low-resolution photos showed a rock formation that resembled a human face, but later spacecraft took photos in higher detail that showed that there was nothing special about the site.[150]
Extraterrestrial_life	The search and study of extraterrestrial life became a science of its own, astrobiology. Also known as exobiology, this discipline is studied by the NASA, the ESA, the INAF, and others. Astrobiology studies life from Earth as well, but with a cosmic perspective. For example, abiogenesis is of interest to astrobiology, not because of the origin of life on Earth, but for the chances of a similar process taking place in other celestial bodies. Many aspects of life, from its definition to its chemistry, are analyzed as either likely to be similar in all forms of life across the cosmos or only native to Earth.[151] Astrobiology, however, remains constrained by the current lack of extraterrestrial life-forms to study, as all life on Earth comes from the same ancestor, and it is hard to infer general characteristics from a group with a single example to analyse.[152]
Extraterrestrial_life	The 20th century came with great technological advances, speculations about future hypothetical technologies, and an increased basic knowledge of science by the general population thanks to science divulgation through the mass media. The public interest in extraterrestrial life and the lack of discoveries by mainstream science led to the emergence of pseudosciences that provided affirmative, if questionable, answers to the existence of aliens. Ufology claims that many unidentified flying objects (UFOs) would be spaceships from alien species, and ancient astronauts hypothesis claim that aliens would have visited Earth in antiquity and prehistoric times but people would have failed to understand it by then.[153] Most UFOs or UFO sightings[154] can be readily explained as sightings of Earth-based aircraft (including top-secret aircraft), known astronomical objects or weather phenomenons, or as hoaxes.[155]
Extraterrestrial_life	Looking beyond the pseudosciences, Lewis White Beck strove to elevate the level of public discourse on the topic of extraterrestrial life by tracing the evolution of philosophical thought over the centuries from ancient times into the modern era. His review of the contributions made by Lucretius, Plutarch, Aristotle, Copernicus, Immanuel Kant, John Wilkins, Charles Darwin and Karl Marx demonstrated that even in modern times, humanity could be profoundly influenced in its search for extraterrestrial life by subtle and comforting archetypal ideas which are largely derived from firmly held religious, philosophical and existential belief systems. On a positive note, however,  Beck further argued that even if the search for extraterrestrial life proves to be unsuccessful, the endeavor itself could have beneficial consequences by assisting humanity in its attempt to actualize superior ways of living here on Earth.[156]
Extraterrestrial_life	By the 21st century, it was accepted that multicellular life in the Solar System can only exist on Earth, but the interest in extraterrestrial life increased regardless. This is a result of the advances in several sciences. The knowledge of planetary habitability allows to consider on scientific terms the likelihood of finding life at each specific celestial body, as it is known which features are beneficial and harmful for life. Astronomy and telescopes also improved to the point exoplanets can be confirmed and even studied, increasing the number of search places. Life may still exist elsewhere in the Solar System in unicellular form, but the advances in spacecraft allow to send robots to study samples in situ, with tools of growing complexity and reliability. Although no extraterrestrial life has been found and life may still be just a rarity from Earth, there are scientific reasons to suspect that it can exist elsewhere, and technological advances that may detect it if it does.[157]
Extraterrestrial_life	"Many scientists are optimistic about the chances of finding alien life. In the words of SETI's Frank Drake, ""All we know for sure is that the sky is not littered with powerful microwave transmitters"".[158] Drake noted that it is entirely possible that advanced technology results in communication being carried out in some way other than conventional radio transmission. At the same time, the data returned by space probes, and giant strides in detection methods, have allowed science to begin delineating habitability criteria on other worlds, and to confirm that at least other planets are plentiful, though aliens remain a question mark. The Wow! signal, detected in 1977 by a SETI project, remains a subject of speculative debate.[159]"
Extraterrestrial_life	"On the other hand, other scientists are pessimistic. Jacques Monod wrote that ""Man knows at last that he is alone in the indifferent immensity of the universe, whence which he has emerged by chance"".[160] In 2000, geologist and paleontologist Peter Ward and astrobiologist Donald Brownlee published a book entitled Rare Earth: Why Complex Life is Uncommon in the Universe.[161][better source needed] In it, they discussed the Rare Earth hypothesis, in which they claim that Earth-like life is rare in the universe, whereas microbial life is common. Ward and Brownlee are open to the idea of evolution on other planets that is not based on essential Earth-like characteristics such as DNA and carbon."
Extraterrestrial_life	"As for the possible risks, theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking warned in 2010 that humans should not try to contact alien life forms. He warned that aliens might pillage Earth for resources. ""If aliens visit us, the outcome would be much as when Columbus landed in America, which didn't turn out well for the Native Americans"", he said.[162] Jared Diamond had earlier expressed similar concerns.[163] On 20 July 2015, Hawking and Russian billionaire Yuri Milner, along with the SETI Institute, announced a well-funded effort, called the Breakthrough Initiatives, to expand efforts to search for extraterrestrial life. The group contracted the services of the 100-meter Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope in West Virginia in the United States and the 64-meter Parkes Telescope in New South Wales, Australia.[164] On 13 February 2015, scientists (including Geoffrey Marcy, Seth Shostak, Frank Drake and David Brin) at a convention of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, discussed Active SETI and whether transmitting a message to possible intelligent extraterrestrials in the Cosmos was a good idea;[165][166] one result was a statement, signed by many, that a ""worldwide scientific, political and humanitarian discussion must occur before any message is sent"".[167]"
Extraterrestrial_life	The 1967 Outer Space Treaty and the 1979 Moon Agreement define rules of planetary protection against potentially hazardous extraterrestrial life. COSPAR also provides guidelines for planetary protection.[168] A committee of the United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs had in 1977 discussed for a year strategies for interacting with extraterrestrial life or intelligence. The discussion ended without any conclusions. As of 2010, the UN lacks response mechanisms for the case of an extraterrestrial contact.[169]
Extraterrestrial_life	"One of the NASA divisions is the Office of Safety and Mission Assurance (OSMA), also known as the Planetary Protection Office. A part of its mission is to ""rigorously preclude backward contamination of Earth by extraterrestrial life.""[170]"
Extraterrestrial_life	In 2016, the Chinese Government released a white paper detailing its space program. According to the document, one of the research objectives of the program is the search for extraterrestrial life.[171] It is also one of the objectives of the Chinese Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST) program.[172]
Extraterrestrial_life	"In 2020, Dmitry Rogozin, the head of the Russian space agency, said the search for extraterrestrial life is one of the main goals of deep space research. 
He also acknowledged the possibility of existence of primitive life on other planets of the Solar System.[173]"
Extraterrestrial_life	"The French space agency has an office for the study of ""non-identified aero spatial phenomena"".[174][175] The agency is maintaining a publicly accessible database of such phenomena, with over 1600 detailed entries. According to the head of the office, the vast majority of entries have a mundane explanation; but for 25% of entries, their extraterrestrial origin can neither be confirmed nor denied.[174]"
Extraterrestrial_life	"In 2020, chairman of the Israel Space Agency Isaac Ben-Israel stated that the probability of detecting life in outer space is ""quite large"". But he disagrees with his former colleague Haim Eshed who stated that there are contacts between an advanced alien civilisation and some of Earth's governments.[176]"
Extraterrestrial_life	Although the idea of extraterrestrial peoples became feasible once astronomy developed enough to understand the nature of planets, they were not thought of as being any different from humans. Having no scientific explanation for the origin of mankind and its relation to other species, there was no reason to expect them to be any other way. This was changed by the 1859 book On the Origin of Species by Charles Darwin, which proposed the theory of evolution. Now with the notion that evolution on other planets may take other directions, science fiction authors created bizarre aliens, clearly distinct from humans. A usual way to do that was to add body features from other animals, such as insects or octopuses. Costuming and special effects feasibility alongside budget considerations forced films and TV series to tone down the fantasy, but these limitations lessened since the 1990s with the advent of computer-generated imagery (CGI), and later on as CGI became more effective and less expensive.[177]
Extraterrestrial_life	Real-life events sometimes captivate people's imagination and this influences the works of fiction. For example, during the Barney and Betty Hill incident, the first recorded claim of an alien abduction, the couple reported that they were abducted and experimented on by aliens with oversized heads, big eyes, pale grey skin, and small noses, a description that eventually became the grey alien archetype once used in works of fiction.[177]
Flying_saucer	A flying saucer, or flying disc, is a purported type of disc-shaped unidentified flying object (UFO). The term was coined in 1947 by the United States (US) news media for the objects pilot Kenneth Arnold claimed flew alongside his airplane above Washington State, specifically over Mount Rainier looking for a lost military aircraft. Newspapers reported Arnold's story with speed estimates implausible for aircraft of the period. The story preceded a wave of hundreds of sightings across the United States, including the Roswell incident and the Flight 105 UFO sighting. A National Guard pilot died in pursuit of a flying saucer in 1948,[1] and civilian research groups and conspiracy theories developed around the topic. The concept quickly spread to other countries. Early reports speculated about secret military technology, but flying saucers became synonymous with aliens by 1950. The more general military terms unidentified flying object (UFO) and unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP) have gradually replaced the term over time.
Flying_saucer	In science fiction, UFO sightings, UFO conspiracy theories, and broader popular culture, saucers are typically piloted by nonhuman beings.[3] Most reported sightings describe saucers in the distance and do not mention a crew. Descriptions of the craft vary considerably. Early reports emphasized speed, but the descriptions shifted over the decades to the objects mostly hovering. They are generally said to be round, sometimes with a protrusion on top, but details of the shape vary between reports. Witnesses describe flying saucers as silent or deafening, with lights of every color, and flying alone or in formation. Size estimates range from small enough to fit in a living room to over 2,000 feet (610 m) in diameter. Sightings are most frequent at night. Astronomer Donald Howard Menzel concluded that the reports were too varied to all be describing the same type of objects. Experts have identified most reported saucers as known phenomena, including astronomical objects such as Venus, airborne objects such as balloons, and optical phenomena such as sun dogs.
Flying_saucer	1950s pop culture embraced flying saucers. The discs appeared in film, television, literature, music, toys, and advertising. Their reports influenced religious movements and were the subject of military investigations. The shape became visual shorthand for alien invaders. During the 1960s, saucers waned in popularity as UFOs were reported and depicted in other shapes. Discs ceased to be viewed as the standard shape for alien spacecraft but are still often depicted, sometimes for their retro value to evoke the early Cold War era.
Flying_saucer	"Reports of fantastical aircraft predate the first flying saucers.[5]: 24  In antiquity, mysterious lights in the sky were interpreted as spiritual phenomena.[6] In the 1800s, many newspapers reported massive airships with glowing lights and humming engines. These are often seen as precursors to flying saucer and UFO sightings.[7] On January 25, 1878, the Denison Daily News printed an article in which John Martin, a local farmer, reported an object resembling a balloon flying ""at wonderful speed"". The newspaper said it appeared to be about the size of a saucer from his perspective, one of the first uses of the word ""saucer"" in association with a UFO.[8] An outbreak of a number of  sightings of mystery airships occurred in America in 1896 and 1897. During World War II, Allied pilots reported balls of light following their planes. They named the lights foo fighters and believed they were advanced Axis aircraft.[9]: 2 "
Flying_saucer	"Many aspects of the typical flying saucer first appeared in science fiction.[10][11]: 206–8  French sociologist Bertrand Méheust noted, for example, Jean de La Hire's 1908 novel La Roue fulgurante (The Lightning Wheel).[12] In the novel, a flying disc-shaped machine abducts the protagonists via a beam of light.[11]: 206–8  Science fiction magazine Amazing Stories began publishing ""The Shaver Mystery"" in 1945. Written by Richard Sharpe Shaver and edited by Raymond A. Palmer, they were science fiction tales about technologically advanced ""detrimental robots"" that abducted humans, but the stories were presented as a true account of Shaver's life.[3][13]: 1–3  Until the magazine ceased printing The Shaver Mystery, Amazing Stories' letter column was regularly full of readers sharing their own purportedly true sightings of the robots.[13]: 3 "
Flying_saucer	Before the flying saucer was coined as a term, fantasy artwork in pulp magazines depicted flying discs.[4] Skeptical physicist Milton Rothman noted the appearance of so-called flying saucers in the fantasy artwork of 1930s pulp science fiction magazines, by artists such as Frank R. Paul.[14][15] One of Paul's earliest depictions of a flying saucer appeared on the cover of the November 1929 issue of Hugo Gernsback's pulp science fiction magazine Science Wonder Stories.[4] Science fiction illustrator Frank Wu wrote:
Flying_saucer	The point is that the idea of space vehicles shaped like flying saucers was imprinted in the national psyche for many years prior to 1947, when the Roswell incident took place. It didn't take much stretching for the first observers of UFOs to assume that the unknown objects hovering in the sky had the same disk shape as the science fictional vehicles.[14]
Flying_saucer	"The modern flying saucer concept, including the association with aliens, can be traced to the 1947 Kenneth Arnold UFO sighting.[16][6] On June 24, 1947, businessman and amateur pilot Kenneth Arnold landed at the Yakima, Washington airstrip. He told staff and friends that he'd seen nine unusual airborne objects.[17] Arnold estimated their speed at 1,700 miles per hour, beyond the capabilities of known aircraft.[16] Newspapers soon contacted Arnold for interviews. The East Oregonian reported his supposed aircraft as ""saucer-like"".[18] In a June 26 radio interview, Arnold described them as ""something like a pie plate that was cut in half with a sort of a convex triangle in the rear"".[19][20] Headline writers coined the terms ""flying saucer"" and ""flying disk"" (or ""disc"") for the story.[16][21] Arnold later told CBS News that the early coverage ""did not quote me properly [...] when I described how they flew, I said that they flew like they take a saucer and throw it across the water. Most of the newspapers misunderstood and misquoted that, too. They said that I said that they were saucer-like; I said that they flew in a saucer-like fashion.""[22] The circular shape of typical flying saucers may be due to reporters mistaking Arnold's ""saucer-like"" description of motion.[16]"
Flying_saucer	"Arnold's story preceded a wave of hundreds of flying saucer reports.[16] Lieutenant Governor of Idaho Donald S. Whitehead claimed he saw a fast-moving object resembling a meteor around the time of Arnold's sighting.[23] In early July, head of Air Materiel Command Nathan F. Twining told reporters that ""anyone seeing the objects"" should contact Wright Field.[24] The next widely publicized report was the sighting by a United Airlines crew on July 4 of nine more disc-like objects pacing their plane over Idaho.[25][9]: 10 "
Flying_saucer	"The public was divided on the potential origin of the saucers.[26]: 206  Arnold told military intelligence officers he suspected the discs were experimental aircraft, and early newspapers reported Arnold saying, ""I don't know what they were—unless they were guided missiles.""[27][16] News media speculated on a Soviet origin, and many war veterans connected them to the foo fighters seen during World War II.[28][5]: 21   A Gallup Poll found that 90% of Americans were aware of the saucer stories, and 16 percent believed they were secret military weapons, most likely American. The most common explanation given was some type of illusion or mirage.[29][30] Less than one percent believed they were alien craft.[29][26]: 206  One report from Seattle, Washington, described a hammer and sickle painted onto a flying disc.[26]: 207  The stories spread to other countries, where they were influenced by local political and social concerns. In Europe, which was still recovering from the Second World War, saucers were often reported with rocket-like features. German newspapers reported flying saucers that exploded or had tails of fire.[31] The names for the discs were largely derived from the English ""flying saucer"" including the French soucoupe volante, Spanish platillo volante, Portuguese disco voador, Swedish flygande tefat, German fliegende Untertasse, and Italian disco volante.[32][5]: 83–6 "
Flying_saucer	"The 1947 sightings peaked in the days after the Fourth of July and declined rapidly through mid-July.[33][34] Multiple organizations offered $1,000 rewards for hard proof.[35][36] In the widely reported July 7, 1947, Twin Falls saucer hoax, four teenagers in Idaho fabricated a crashed disc from jukebox parts.[37][38] On July 8, the Army Air Force base at Roswell, New Mexico, issued a press release saying that they had recovered a ""flying disc"" from a nearby ranch; the so-called Roswell UFO incident made front-page news.[39][40] International media covered the military's announcement of a crashed disc, but within 24 hours were reporting the military's retraction and explanation that the material was balloon debris.[41][34] By July 11, the most widely reported story was a North Hollywood resident's claim that a 30-inch galvanized iron disc containing glass radio tubes had crashed in his garden. Newspapers quoted Fire Battalion Chief Wallace Newcombe's assessment, ""It doesn't look to me like it could fly.""[42][34]"
Flying_saucer	The Air Force collected over a hundred reports at Wright Field, now Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio.[43] Air Force General Nathan Twining established Project SAUCER, later renamed Project Sign,[44] the first in a series of UFO investigations by the US Government.[45] Other national governments followed suit. Canada began Project Magnet and the United Kingdom launched the Flying Saucer Working Party in 1950, which attributed saucer reports to meteorological phenomena, astronomical phenomena, misidentification, optical illusions, misconceptions, or hoaxes.[46][47]
Flying_saucer	"By the 1950s, the term ""flying saucer"" was widely associated with extraterrestrial life.[5]: 50  After commercial pilots Clarence Chiles and John Whitted reported a glowing cylindrical object flying past their plane in 1948, the US Air Force began to seriously investigate the possibility of an alien origin, but also concluded that reported discs ""seem inconsistent with the requirements for space travel.""[5]: 58–59 [9]: 22–23  In a 1950 interview on flying saucers, Kenneth Arnold said, ""if it's not made by our science or our Army Air Forces, I am inclined to believe it's of an extra-terrestrial origin"".[16] This extraterrestrial hypothesis was accompanied by other unusual theories. Meade Layne speculated that they came from an alternate dimension.[48]: 16  Many people claimed to be the inventors of the discs but could offer no evidence.[5]: 87–90  From 1947 to 1970, there was a broad range of overlapping and contradictory explanations for the saucers' origin and purpose, even among proponents.[49]: 32 "
Flying_saucer	"Beliefs about flying saucers were influenced by pulp science fiction.[49] Amazing Stories editor Ray Palmer transitioned from publishing the purportedly true Shaver Mystery, to publishing and organizing UFO investigations.[5]: 52–56  In 1946, Palmer published Fred Crisman's letters about his encounters with underground beings.[50] The following year, Crisman sent Palmer pale metallic fragments along with a report from his employee, Harold Dahl, about a malfunctioning flying saucer.[51][52] Palmer recruited Kenneth Arnold to investigate Crisman and Dahl's Maury Island incident. The fragments turned out to be slag from a local smelter, but the men in black that Crisman and Dahl claimed were following them would become a common element in later UFO literature.[51][52] Gray Barker popularized the idea of ""men in black"" who intimidate or silence UFO witnesses in his book They Knew Too Much About Flying Saucers.[53] Palmer launched the magazine Fate in 1948, claiming to offer ""the truth about flying saucers"".[5]: 54  It was the first of many non-fiction paranormal magazines, a genre that flourished in the 1950s.[13]: 3 "
Flying_saucer	"A flying saucer movement developed during the 1950s.[5]: 83  It was influenced by scientific research, occult practices, pop culture, existing religions, and earlier myths. In reports and in popular media such as the 1951 film The Day the Earth Stood Still, saucers and their pilots were characterized as messengers.[54]: 275  The first wave of so-called contactees, George Van Tassel, George Adamski, Truman Bethurum, Orfeo Angelucci, and George Hunt Williamson, all claimed to have ridden aboard the saucers and brought back messages for humanity.[48]: 103–119  New religions and institutions arose around the contactees.[48]: 4  Van Tassel built the Integratron, a domed structure near Landers, California, intended to facilitate further contact with aliens, physical rejuvenation, and a kind of spiritual time travel.[48]: 132  According to George King, he founded the Aetherius Society—a new religious movement influenced by theosophy—at the direct instruction of an extraterrestrial.[48]: 140  Some existing religions began to incorporate flying saucers. The Nation of Islam taught that the end of the world would be brought about by the ""Mother Wheel"" or ""Mother Plane"", a flying saucer half a mile wide.[54]: 280–281  During the same time that Margaret Murray's ""Old Religion"" or witch-cult hypothesis was being discredited in academic circles, its core idea—a lost civilization remembered in myth—was being embraced in pulp fiction, occult groups, and the growing UFO movement.[55] Several authors speculated that ancient astronauts piloting UFOs were the cause of myths and religions. Schoolteacher Robert Dione wrote God Drives a Flying Saucer to reframe biblical miracles and the Miracle of the Sun as the work of humanoid aliens piloting flying saucers. Later, Erich von Däniken released Chariots of the Gods?, a work of pseudoscience that attributed ancient artifacts and monuments to its purported ancient astronauts.[56]"
Flying_saucer	"Ufology developed as a parallel social movement.[57]: 63  Well-known Variety columnist Frank Scully published Behind the Flying Saucers in 1950. The book presents the Aztec, New Mexico, crashed saucer hoax as the true account of an alien craft that ""gently pancaked to earth like Sonja Henie imitating a dying swan"" and was recovered by the United States government. The hoaxers were convicted of fraud for selling useless dowsing equipment to the oil industry based on a claimed alien origin, but the book described one of the men as a doctor with ""more degrees than a thermometer"".[58][48]: 34  Donald Keyhoe took a ""nuts and bolts"" approach to the idea of the government covering up alien life in his 1950 book The Flying Saucers Are Real.[48]: 18, 109  When the popular and respected Life magazine ran ""Have We Visitors From Space?"" in 1952, taking seriously ideas of alien visitors, a wave of sightings followed.[59]: 123  The 1952 sightings spurred Leonard H. Stringfield to form an early UFO investigation group called the Civilian Investigating Group for Aerial Phenomena and to publish research on UFOs.[5]: 96  Albert K. Bender started his own International Flying Saucer Bureau in Bridgeport, Connecticut, in 1952.[5]: 97  Influenced by these works, James W. Moseley began to tour the country interviewing witnesses and distributing a newsletter for the growing saucer subculture.[5]: 98 "
Flying_saucer	"Within a decade of the first saucer sightings, reports spread to other countries, leading to the emergence of local groups and ufologists.[5]: 103  Antonio Ribera started Centro de Estudios Interplanetarios in Spain, and Edgar Jarrold founded the Australia Flying Saucer Bureau.[5]: 104  In France, UFO groups overlapped with occult groups and the anti-nuclear movement.[5]: 108  Reports have been more often made in the countries where UFO groups are in operation, such as the United States, France, Spain, the United Kingdom, Brazil, Chile, and Argentina.[60] By the end of the decade, The Case for the UFO author Morris K. Jessup reflected on his field: ""This embryonic science is as full of cults, feuds, and dogmas as a dog is of fleas. There are probably more opinions about the nature and purpose of UFO's as there are Ufologers.""[61][5]: 115 "
Flying_saucer	"UFO photography emerged as a subgenre of documentary photography, showing often blurry or abstract discs framed by otherwise everyday settings.[62] Notable examples include the 1950 McMinnville photographs,[63][64][26]: 207–208  the Passaic UFO photographs,[65] and the photographs of contactee George Adamski.[62] Some of the alleged flying saucer photographs of the era were hoaxes, created using everyday objects such as hubcaps.[66] German rocket scientist Walther Johannes Riedel analyzed George Adamski's UFO photos and found them to be faked. The UFO's ""landing struts"" were General Electric light bulbs with GE logos visible on them.[67][68] UFO researcher Joel Carpenter identified the body of Adamski's ""flying saucer"" as the lampshade from a 1930s pressure lantern.[69][70]"
Flying_saucer	"Flying saucers are now considered retro and emblematic of the 1950s and of science fiction B movies.[71][66] The term ""flying saucer"" was gradually supplanted by ""UFO"" and later ""UAP"".[72] Discs ceased to be the standard shape in UFO reports,[73][74] and a broader variety of objects were reported.[75] Recent reports more often describe spherical and triangular UFOs.[76][77]"
Flying_saucer	"Experts have identified the majority of flying saucer and broader UFO reports with known phenomena.[78] British government investigations in the 1950s found that the vast majority of reports were misidentifications or hoaxes.[5]: 111  Common explanations for saucer sightings include the planet Venus, weather phenomena such as ice crystals, balloons, and airborne trash.[79] The US Navy and General Mills launched thousands of top-secret Skyhook spy balloons by the mid-1950s. Because they floated at high altitude, it was difficult to judge the speed of the massive balloons, and they were widely reported as flying saucers.[80] Kentucky Air National Guard pilot Thomas Mantell died while pursuing an unknown round object ""of tremendous size"",[9]: 18–22  later identified as a Skyhook balloon.[81] News media reported Mantell as having crashed ""chasing [a] flying saucer"", and some lost Skyhook balloons were tracked down using news reports of UFO sightings.[1]"
Flying_saucer	"In the mid-1950s, psychologists began to study why people believed in flying saucers despite the lack of evidence. French psychiatrist Georges Heuyer viewed the phenomenon as a kind of global folie à deux, or shared delusion, triggered by fear of a possible nuclear holocaust.[5]: 182  In the 1970s, French UFO researcher Michel Monnerie compared reports that were later identified with those that remained unexplained. Monnerie found no difference in the frequency of paranormal phenomena reported alongside the sightings identified later as mundane known objects. These findings led him to develop the thesis that the saucer-specific experiences were a ""psychosocial"" process of myth-making triggered by but not caused by aerial phenomena. This psychosocial UFO hypothesis became a popular explanation in France.[82][5]: 249–250 "
Flying_saucer	"Eyewitness descriptions differ in reported appearance, movement, and purpose. In a 1963 overview of flying saucers, astronomer Donald Howard Menzel found some broad traits across sightings but noted that ""no two reports describe exactly the same kind of UFO.""[83]: 7  Menzel found saucers were usually reported as round but included objects shaped like dining saucers, teardrops, cigars, kidney beans, the planet Saturn, and yarn spindles. Saucers often were reported with a dome or knob-shaped protrusion on the top side. Size	estimates ranged from 20 feet to over 2,000 feet (610 m) in diameter. Menzel found saucers reported in nearly every color, often glowing or flashing. The sightings had little consistency in reported movement. Witnesses described hearing sounds ranging from a thunderclap to total silence. Sightings typically took place at night, around sunset or sunrise. Almost all witnesses described distant saucers in flight.[83] Menzel concluded, ""No single phenomenon could possibly display such infinite variety.""[83]: 9 "
Flying_saucer	If a witness describes a saucer's crew, they usually regard them as extraterrestrial.[22] Grey aliens gradually became the most reported type of pilot, but a vast range of beings have been reported.[84] The diversity was greater in the 1950s and early 1960s, when witnesses reported the aliens variously as hairy, hairless, monstrous, gorgeous, gigantic, dwarfish, robotic, insectoid, avian, Nordic, or grey-skinned.[60][22] Historian Greg Eghigian argues that this gradual standardization indicates a cultural process to create a broadly recognizable design.[60]
Flying_saucer	"Witnesses consistently describe and depict flying saucers as ahead of contemporary technology. When comparing the 1947 saucer reports to the mystery airships of the 1800s, sociologist Robert Bartholomew found that the claimed observations ""reflected popular social and cultural expectations of each period"".[26]: 209  The mystery airship sightings of the 1800s included details such as metal hulls, propellers, searchlights, and large wings.[26]: 195  The 1947 sightings—occurring months before Chuck Yeager broke the sound barrier—emphasized the ""incredible speed"" of flying saucers.[85]: 171   While most 1947 reports focused on speed, this fell to 41 percent in 1971 and 22 percent in 1986.[85]: 173–174  In the 1950s, hovering flying saucers were associated with contactees and hoaxes. By 1986, almost half of reported UFOs were said to hover slowly or remain motionless.[85]: 174 "
Flying_saucer	In popular media, flying saucers underwent a change in motion similar to the shift in eyewitness reports. Early portrayals emphasized high speed maneuvers, but later media gradually shifted to slowly hovering discs.[85]: 173–175  Early films such as The Flying Saucer (1950) and film serials such as Bruce Gentry – Daredevil of the Skies (1949), show saucers streaking past at high speeds. The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951) mentions high speeds tracked by radar but also includes a slow landing scene. The 1960s television series The Invaders prominently features a slow landing scene in every episode. Many later iconic flying saucer films, including Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977) and Fire in the Sky (1993), depict hovering and slow movements.[85]: 175 
Flying_saucer	Since the late 1940s, flying discs have increasingly become associated with a cultural conception of aliens that reflects the social and political anxieties of the 20th century. Fictional flying saucers represent concerns about atomic warfare, the Cold War, loss of bodily integrity, xenophobia, government secrecy, and the question of whether humanity is alone in the universe.[86] Reports from witnesses influenced popular media, which led to greater interest in flying saucers.[86] For the film Earth vs. the Flying Saucers, producer Charles H. Schneer adapted Donald Keyhoe's UFO books for the screenplay, while special effects artist Ray Harryhausen consulted with contactee George Adamski about the saucer design.[87] No correlation has been found between the release of major UFO films and spikes in sightings.[5]: 222  A disc, often domed or emitting a beam of light, has become visual shorthand for aliens.[66] In 2017, the flying saucer emoji was added to Unicode.[88]
Flying_saucer	"Although the symbol now signifies alien life, similar motifs had unrelated religious and astronomical meanings in the past. Some ufologists have attempted to re-interpret premodern art to support pseudohistorical claims of ancient alien interactions with humanity. Ufologists claim that early portrayals of flying discs can establish a historical basis for their existence as physical craft or some other type of external phenomena. However, experts have consistently explained purported portrayals of ancient UFOs as artifacts of the cultures producing them. For example, Italian Renaissance painter Carlo Crivelli put a disc-shaped element in his 1486 altarpiece The Annunciation, with Saint Emidius that art historian Massimo Polidoro described as ""a vortex of angels in the clouds"". The artists and audiences of the time understood it as an artistic device representing the influence of the Christian God, not extraterrestrials. The device is seen more clearly in many contemporary works, notably Luca Signorelli's 1491 Annunciation.[89]"
Flying_saucer	"Several precursors to modern flying saucers appeared in science fiction literature, including The Shaver Mystery.[90] Richard Sharpe Shaver's stories about a secret technologically advanced civilization of ""detrimental robots"" inside the earth were published as a true account of his life.[49] Backlash from the science fiction community carried over to UFO literature.[13] Saucers did appear in conventional science fiction,[91] but a genre emerged that treated fantastical stories as either true or plausibly true.[92] The debut issue of Mystic magazine asked readers, ""When you read this story, you will tell yourself that it is fiction; the editors assure you that it is. But what if—it isn't?""[93] The Fortec Conspiracy, a science fiction novel, both drew from and fed into crashed saucer rumors.[94] Major newspapers rarely did reviews for saucer books but printed their sensationalist advertisements claiming to prove that flying saucers had landed or were being covered up. Cultural studies scholar Jonathan Gray describes this type of widely-viewed alarmist ad as a paratext (related to the central text but not a part of it), which can reach a much broader audience than the text itself.[95]"
Flying_saucer	Advertisements leveraged cultural interest in flying saucers from the earliest reports. Magazines were promoted as offering skeptical, debunking explanations for the phenomenon. From 1947 into the 1970s, marketing leveraged the discs' potential as advanced technology. By the 1980s, saucers in advertisement were used to evoke awe towards their potential pilots more than futurism.[95]
Flying_saucer	"Aliens and flying discs were common in 1950s science fiction comics that flourished after the Golden Age of Comic Books.[97] Launched in the 1960s, the comic book anthology UFO Flying Saucers featured illustrations of supposedly real sightings.[97] The opening to its first issue declared, ""Our scientists have seen them! Our airmen have fought them!""[98] As the 1950s progressed, former pulp readers turned their attention to the growing medium of television.[99]"
Flying_saucer	"Many early portrayals of flying saucers linked them to the Cold War.[5]: 65  The 1949 film serial Bruce Gentry – Daredevil of the Skies featured a man-made flying saucer,[100] and the 1950 film The Flying Saucer focused on Cold War espionage.[5]: 65  Saucer films in the 1950s featured alien pilots, but many continued to center on Cold War fears.[101]: 14, 67  The Thing from Another World (1951) was a loose adaptation of John W. Campbell's ""Who Goes There?"", updated to include aliens and relocated to Alaska, where Americans feared a Russian attack.[101]: 44  Later that year, The Day the Earth Stood Still had its human-looking alien Klaatu give audiences explicit warnings about a possible nuclear holocaust.[101]: 4  The Day the Earth Stood Still and The Thing from Another World were financial successes that established the market for an ""alien visitor"" subgenre of science fiction that merged flying saucers into existing space opera tropes.[5]: 66  Slowly hovering discs, such as the one from the landing scene in The Day the Earth Stood Still, appeared throughout science fiction, including It Came from Outer Space (1953),  Earth vs. the Flying Saucers (1956), and the television series The Invaders.[85]: 175  While contactees described aliens as benevolent messengers, Hollywood films often depicted them as monstrous antagonists.[5]: 222 "
Flying_saucer	Other countries adapted the largely American phenomenon at different times, adding elements of the local culture. Early British films were low-budget productions such as Devil Girl from Mars (1954) and Stranger from Venus (1954).[102][103] Japanese filmmakers incorporated flying discs and alien invaders into the tokusatsu tradition in mid-50s films such as Fearful Attack of the Flying Saucers and Warning from Space.[104] Indian cinema began to incorporate alien invaders in the 1960s, starting with the Tamil-language Kalai Arasi.[105] An adaptation of Bankubabur Bandhu by Satyajit Ray was never completed but may have influenced other works of science fiction.[106] In Spain, alien-themed television shows became popular in the 1960s.[5]: 174 
Flying_saucer	"Flying saucers quickly spread to other genres. In Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's big-budget Forbidden Planet, a futuristic 1956 adaptation of William Shakespeare's play The Tempest, humans travel through space in the United Planets Cruiser C-57D, a ship resembling a flying saucer.[107] The Twilight Zone episodes ""The Monsters Are Due on Maple Street"", ""Third from the Sun"", ""Death Ship"", ""To Serve Man"", ""The Invaders"", and ""On Thursday We Leave for Home"", all make use of the iconic saucer from Forbidden Planet.
[108] The C-57D was followed by other disc-shaped spacecraft in broader science fiction, such as the Jupiter 2 from the television series Lost in Space (1965–1968).[109] Saucers appeared in the television series Babylon 5 (1994–1998) as starships used by a race called the Vree.[110] Aliens in the film Independence Day (1996) attacked humanity in giant city-sized saucer-shaped spaceships.[111]"
Flying_saucer	"Flying saucers were supplanted by other concepts and fell out of favor with Hollywood filmmakers.[66][101]: 106  After 1956, American saucer films were mainly B movies. Plan 9 from Outer Space is infamous for its ""pie-pan"" saucers dangled from visible piano wire.[112][101]: 62, 93  Television shows and British films continued to depict flying discs and alien invaders into the 1960s.[101]: 106  Various saucer designs have appeared in Doctor Who, such as those used by the Daleks in Daleks' Invasion Earth 2150 A.D. or the Cybermen in ""The Tenth Planet"".[113][114] Italy produced a wave of low-budget films, often space operas or comedies, including Omicron (1963) and Il disco volante (1964).[101]: 107–122  By the end of the 1960s, Japan, Italy, and Britain largely ceased producing saucer films.[101]: 143  Disc-shaped spacecraft fell out of favor in straight science fiction but continued to be used ironically in comedies.[115][66] The image is often invoked retrofuturistically to produce a nostalgic feel in period works.[86] For example, Mars Attacks! (1996) draws on the flying saucer as part of the larger satire of 1950s B movie tropes.[116]"
Flying_saucer	"The sleek, silver flying saucer is widely regarded as a symbol of 1950s culture.[66] The motif is common in Googie architecture and Atomic Age décor.[117]  Notable flying saucer structures include Seattle's Space Needle and Los Angeles International Airport's Theme Building.[118][119] Googie architecture in California, such as the Chemosphere home, influenced the futuristic structures in the 1960s cartoon The Jetsons. The cartoon popularized the style to such an extent, that it is often referred to as the ""Jetsons look"".[120] Architect Frank Lloyd Wright, who collaborated on the design of the flying saucer in The Day The Earth Stood Still, went on to use the flying saucer as an architectural motif.[121][122] Wright's circular Annunciation Greek Orthodox Church in Wauwatosa, Wisconsin, United States, is capped by a flattened dome over a hundred feet across.[123]"
Flying_saucer	"Spaceships are one of the subjects of novelty architecture. Also known as mimetic architecture, novelty architecture is the practice of creating structures shaped like other existing objects.[124] The Communist-era Kielce Bus Station in Kielce, Poland, was designed by architect Edward Modrzejewski [pl] to resemble a UFO.[125] The historic landmark arena in Katowice, Poland, is called Spodek (Polish for ""saucer"") based on its resemblance to the saucers of 1960s science fiction.[126] Other modernist and brutalist UFO structures include the Ukrainian Institute of Scientific, Technical and Economic Information,[127] Bulgaria's concrete Buzludzha monument,[128] the Most SNP in Bratislava, Slovakia,[129] and The Flying Saucer in Sharjah, United Arab Emirates.[130] The Westall UFO was commemorated with the Grange Reserve UFO Park, featuring a UFO with red slides modeled after the reported sighting.[131] Roswell, New Mexico, is a UFO tourist destination in the Southwestern United States. Many structures in Roswell, including the streetlights and the McDonald's, are designed around alien themes.[132] Moonbeam, Ontario, Canada, has an alien for its mascot and a prominent roadside flying saucer at its welcome center.[133] UFO-shaped homes include the Futuro pods designed by Matti Suuronen,[134] the former Sanzhi UFO houses from the Sanzhi District, New Taipei, Taiwan,[135] and artist Harry Visser's iconic home in Roodepoort, Johannesburg, South Africa.[136]"
Flying_saucer	"Flying saucers were a ubiquitous part of pop culture from 1947 into the mid-1970s.[97] Flying disc motifs were used in toys and other novelties soon after the earliest reports. The frisbee was released in 1948 and initially branded the ""flying saucer"".[137] Flying saucer candy was introduced in the 1950s when a Belgian producer of communion wafers had a dip in sales.[138] Along with other vintage candies, they have since seen renewed interest from customers as ""retro"".[139] In the 1950s and early 1960s, Japan was a major manufacturer of tin toys often with space themes such as robots, rockets, and flying discs.[140] Throughout the 1950s, musicians such as Billy Lee Riley, Jesse Lee Turner, and Betty Johnson released novelty songs about flying discs and alien invaders. Bill Buchanan and Dickie Goodman released the first break-in record, ""The Flying Saucer"", which took the form of a mock news broadcast covering an alien invasion.[141] Disneyland opened Flying Saucers, an attraction where guests could pilot a hovering disc by tilting their own body.[75]"
Flying_saucer	"Video games have a long history of depicting flying saucers, typically as antagonists.[142] In the arcades, the popular early shooting games Asteroids (1979) and Space Invaders (1978) featured flying saucers as ""bonus"" enemies that only emerged briefly.[143] Super Mario Land, one of Nintendo's launch titles for the original Game Boy, contained spaceships modeled after photographs by George Adamski and set among various monuments falsely attributed to ancient astronauts, such as the Egyptian pyramids and the monolithic Moai of Easter Island.[144] The XCOM series tasks players with countering an invasion of aliens landing on Earth in flying discs. Saucers have appeared as a craft that players can control in Fortnite, Destroy All Humans, and Spore.[142]"
